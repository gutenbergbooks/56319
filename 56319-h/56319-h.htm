<p class='pindent'>“Say, ma; honest, I don’t want to go in.
Just all I want is to take off my shoes
and socks and walk where the water just comes
up to my ankles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the speaker, a boy of eight, was dressed
in the fashion common to the youth of Los
Angeles and its environment, it is but fair to
state that with the taking off of shoes and socks
the process of disrobing was really far
advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother has let me take mine off,” put in
a bare-legged little girl. “We won’t go into
the water really at all, Mrs. Vernon. Oh,
please let Bobby come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time was morning—a clear, golden,
flower-scented morning in early July. The
place was the sandy shore of Long Beach.
There were few bathers about, as it was Monday,
when the week-enders had returned to
their several occupations, while the pleasure-seekers
living or lodging there were resting
from the strenuous gayety of Sunday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon, a beautiful young woman, in
half-mourning, was strolling with her only
child and the girl, an acquaintance made on
the train, along the sands. They were all transients,
presently to take a train north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby Vernon was a highly interesting child
to look at. Rather small for his age, he was
lithe and shapely. His complexion was delicately
fair, his chestnut hair rather long. All
these things were enough to attract attention;
but above and beyond these were the features.
Blue eyes, cupid mouth, a sensitive upper lip,
an eloquent, chubby little nose—all had this in
common that they were expressive of his every
passing thought and emotion. He had a face,
in a word, at once speaking and engaging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl, Peggy Sansone, a year or two
older, was a brunette, a decided contrast. She
was a chance acquaintance, made by Bobby
on the Pullman, with the result that, once they
had exchanged a few words, there was no more
sleeping during the daylight hours for the
other occupants of that car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon felt in her heart it would be
more prudent to refuse the request. She
feared that she was making a mistake. But
she was just then preoccupied and sad. Now,
sadness is weakening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Bobby, if I give you permission, you
won’t go far? And you’ll be back at the station
in half an hour, and won’t get lost?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the way back to the station,” volunteered
the girl. “And I’ll promise you to
see him back myself. You know, I’ve got my
watch.” Here Peggy, with the sweet vanity
of childhood, held up for view her dainty
wrist watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoopee!” cried Bobby, jumping into his
mother’s arms, planting a kiss on her brow,
dropping down to the sand and, apparently all
in one motion, taking off shoes and socks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Light-heartedly, hand in hand with the girl,
he pattered down the sands to the water. The
two little ones radiated joy and youth and life.
To them the coming half-hour was to be, so
they thought, “a little bit of heaven.” The
girl had no premonition of the saddest day of
her childhood; the boy no thought of the forces
of earth and water that were about to change
so strangely his and his mother’s life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been observed that it was a
day of golden sunshine; but to one conversant
with the waters of Long Beach there was
something ominous about the face of the changing
sea. It was not high tide; but the surf was
showing its milk-white teeth in a beauty profuse
and cruel, with the cruelty of the sea which
takes and returns no more, while the rollers
swept in with a violence and a height that
were unusual. The life savers were watchful
and uneasy. To the two children, however, the
white-lipped ocean was as bland and as gay as
the sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As their feet were covered by an incoming
roller the girl screamed and Bobby danced—both
for the same reason, for sheer joy. Hand
in hand they pattered along, making their way
further and further into the pathway of the
breakers. In a few minutes they had advanced
along the shore to a spot where they were
apparently alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then began a series of daring ventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say!” said Bobby. “This is the first time
in all my life that I ever put my feet in the
Pacific Ocean. But I know how to swim, all
right, and I’m not a bit afraid.” As Bobby
spoke he was moving slowly out into the water,
which was now nearly up to his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold on! You’re going too far,” said the
girl, releasing Bobby’s hand and slipping back.
“I’ve been in often, but I’m afraid just the
same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls are cowards,” Bobby announced.
“Come on, Peggy; I’ll take care of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy by way of return fastened her large,
beautiful dark eyes in hero worship upon her
companion. Nevertheless, instead of accepting
his invitation, she drew back a few steps
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now remember, Bobby, you told your
mother you were only going ankle-deep.
You’re up to your knees now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so,” said Bobby, pausing and turning
his back upon the incoming waves. “I
ought not to break my word. Say, Peggy”—here
Bobby’s face threw itself, every feature
of it, into a splendor of enthusiasm—“do you
think it would be wrong if I were to fall over
and float? Then I wouldn’t be more than
ankle-deep anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy’s large eyes grew larger in glorious
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Bobby being very human—even as you
and I—was not insensible to the girl’s expression.
It spurred him on to do something
really daring. He was tempted at that moment
to forget his mother’s words and to go boldly
out and meet the breakers in their might. For
a few minutes there was a clean-cut battle in
the lad’s soul between love of praise and the
still, small voice we call conscience; as a consequence
of which Bobby’s features twisted
and curled and darkened. The battle was a
short one, and it is only fair to say that the
still, small voice scored a victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the breakers were not interested
in such a fight though it may have appealed
with supreme interest to all the choirs of
angels. The conflict over, Bobby’s eyes grew
bright, and all the sprites of innocent gayety
showed themselves at once in his every feature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peggy,” he began, “you are right. A
promise is a promise—always. And then I
made it to my mother. I would like to show
you a thing or two, but—Why, what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her expression startled him. If ever tragedy
and horror were expressed by the eyes,
Bobby saw these emotions in the beautiful orbs
of Peggy. Her face had lost its rich southern
hue, fear was in her pose and in every feature,
but Bobby saw only the tragedy of the eyes.
They were unforgettable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby!” she gasped. “Run! run!” And
the child followed her own advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, infected by her terror, turned. But
it was too late. Close upon him curled and
roared a huge roller, a white-crested wave. In
the moment he looked upon it Bobby saw the
rollers in a new light. A few moments before
they were gay, frolicsome things, showing their
teeth in laughter. Now they were strange,
strong monsters foaming at the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried Bobby in horror. He said no
more; for as he spoke, the wave caught him,
spun him around, pulled him down, raised him
up, and carried him off in its strong, uncountable
arms towards the deep sea. Bobby kicked
and struggled; but he was swept on as though
he were a toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy, meanwhile having run back twenty
or thirty paces, turned, and wringing her
hands, scanned the troubled waters. She saw
no sign of the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy was young and timid. Upon her
came an unreasoning fear. Bobby was
drowned and maybe it was her fault! Maybe
she would be hanged for murder! And how
could she face a bereaved and already widowed
mother? For the first and only time in her life
Peggy ardently wished she were dead. Then,
looking neither to left nor right, she ran back
along the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby was drowned! But she would tell no
one. For the moment a wild thought of running
away entered her soul. And she would
have run away if she only knew whither to fly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still running, she wept and she prayed. She
ceased her flight only when she came to the
spot where her tiny shoes and socks lay beside
those of Bobby’s. Then she sat down and gave
loose to her grief. When the first fierce desolation
and agony had passed, she put on her
shoes and began to think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly her drawn face relaxed. Her
mother! Had she not always brought her
griefs to that tender, loving soul? She would
seek her at once and tell all. She glanced at
her watch. Forty-five minutes had passed!
She had exceeded her time by a quarter of an
hour. It was nearly train time. There was
not a second to be lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she rose to her feet something unusual
had occurred. The ground beneath her seemed
to be swinging up and down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy was a native. In normal circumstances
she would have been normally excited;
but in her present condition she hardly noticed
that she was in the throes of an earthquake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So calmly ignoring the shouts of men and the
hysteria of women who came running out in
hundreds from house and hotel, Peggy went
forward at a smart trot to bring the awful tidings
to Mrs. Sansone, her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To natives of Los Angeles, or to those who
have spent some years in that beautiful
city—so beautiful that one could easily vision
Adam and Eve as its occupants before the Fall—an
earthquake tremor is just something more
than of passing interest. They remain “unusual
calm” when the house shakes, the pictures
flap upon the wall, and the crockery rattles
in noisy unrest. They regard their earthquakes
as tamed creatures—not more formidable,
practically speaking, than “a thing of
noise and fury, signifying nothing.” When
visitors show agitation at the coming of an
earth tremor, these old inhabitants—and five
years’ residence in Los Angeles makes one
something little short of a patriarch—are almost
scandalized. Should these strangers go
the way that leads to hysteria, the old inhabitants
grow properly indignant, and point out
that all the tremors in the history of Los
Angeles County are as nothing, in point of
damage, as compared to one solitary cyclone
of the Middle West. No doubt they are right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, to a stranger these pranks of
mother earth are fraught with terror. Many
men and women are not only frightened, but
actually become sick. Dizziness and nausea
are not uncommon, although the cause be only
a slight tremor of but three or four seconds’
duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among those affected on this day, so
momentous in her life and that of her only
child, was Mrs. Barbara Vernon. When the
shock came she was resting on the sands under
the shade of one of those gigantic umbrellas
rented out at the beaches as a protection from
the ardent rays of the sun. Beside her sat Mrs.
Sansone, Peggy’s mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” cried Mrs. Vernon, jumping
to her feet and clasping her hands. She would
have run straight into the ocean had not Mrs.
Sansone laid upon her a restraining hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said the old inhabitant, “don’t
be frightened. It’s really nothing at all. We
who live here don’t mind it in the least.” She
patted Mrs. Vernon’s beautiful cheek as she
continued: “Why, my little Peggy sees nothing
in them. The last time we had an earthquake
shock Peggy said that the earth was
trying to do the shimmy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Mrs. Vernon, “I’m feeling so ill!
Let me lean on you, dear. I feel as though I
should faint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sympathetic right arm of Mrs. Sansone
wound itself about the other’s waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many strangers are so affected,” she said.
“But really there’s nothing to fear. God is
here with us right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Barbara Vernon unobtrusively made
the sign of the cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said. “My fear is gone;
but I feel sick, sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lean on my arm, Mrs. Vernon. I will
bring you to our Pullman, where you can lie
down and rest quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the children!” objected Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave that to me. At the worst, Peggy
knows the way, and she is really a very punctual
little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had walked but a few paces, when an
automobile, moving along the sands, came
abreast of them and stopped. The driver, its
sole occupant, leaned out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon,” he said removing his hat,
“but I fear one of you ladies is rather indisposed.
Anything I can do for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed you can,” replied Mrs. Sansone
very promptly. “This lady is suffering from
nausea. The earthquake is something new to
her. You would do us a great favor by bringing
us to the railroad station.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Favor! It will be an immense pleasure
to me.” As he spoke the young man jumped
out, threw open the door of the tonneau, and,
hat in hand, helped the two women in. He
was rather a striking personality, thin almost
to emaciation, and despite the smile now upon
his features, with a face melancholy to the
point of pathos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Los Angeles,” he remarked as he seated
himself at the wheel, “would be the most perfect
place in the world if the earth hereabouts
would only keep sober. If I had my way,”
he continued, in a voice only less pathetic than
his countenance, “I’d give the earth the pledge
for life. It’s a perfect country when it’s
sober.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sansone laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even at that,” continued the melancholy
man, allowing himself the indulgence of a
slight smile, “what does it amount to, a little
bit of an earthquake like that? It is merely
a fly in the amber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree with you absolutely,” said Mrs.
Sansone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which means you’re a native. That other
lady—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Barbara Vernon,” interpolated Mrs.
Sansone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, glad to meet you, ma’am,” said
the stranger, turning his head and smiling ungrudgingly.
“You, I take it, don’t see it as
we do. Instead of a fly in the amber, you
regard it rather as a shark in a swimming
pool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very kind of you,” said Barbara, “to
go out of your way for me. I can’t tell you
how I appreciate your goodness. I shall pray
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver’s face changed from melancholy
to reverence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please remember that,” he said. As he
spoke he thought of the great Thackeray’s
great words on the preciousness of living on in
the heart of one good woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Barbara been his own mother he could
not have been more attentive. He helped her
from the car, placed her in her section, and furtively
slipping a dollar into the porter’s responsive
fist, got that functionary into a state
of useful and eager activity which would have
filled, had he seen it, the Pullman superintendent’s
heart with wild delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t I get you a physician, Mrs. Vernon?”
pleaded the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need none, thank you. You have done
infinitely more than I had any right to expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I am going to leave you in the
hands of this lady—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Estelle Sansone,” supplied the owner
of that name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mrs. Sansone. I am glad to
know your name. And,” he continued, turning
upon Barbara the most melancholy eyes
she had ever seen, while taking reverently her
proffered hand, “I beg you, Mrs. Vernon, to
remember me in—in—to remember me as you
said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed and indeed I will. God bless you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen,” answered the young man thickly.
His face twitched, he paused as though about
to speak, and then suddenly turned and left
the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he strange!” ejaculated Barbara. “I
never saw a more melancholy face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is very strange,” assented Mrs. Sansone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a depth of meaning in her
words, unsuspected by Barbara, for the kind
Italian woman had recognized the good Samaritan.
This melancholy man was, in her
estimation, the greatest screen comedian in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” continued Barbara, when the porter
had placed a second pillow under her head,
“with all his melancholy, he is so kind and so
good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t understand,” commented the Italian.
Again the depth of this remark was lost
upon Barbara. For Mrs. Sansone knew much
of the gossip concerning the great comedian.
She knew that he had figured in many episodes
which, to say the least, were anything but
savory. And now she had met the man in a
few intimate moments and seen him kind, gentle,
gracious, and with a reverence for a good
woman and a good woman’s prayers that had
filled her with a feeling akin to awe. As she
ministered lovingly to Barbara she meditated
upon these opposing truths, and so meditating
took a new lesson in the school of experience,
a lesson the fruits of which are wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am anxious about my boy,” said Barbara
opening her eyes and endeavoring vainly
to sit up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sansone threw a quick glance about
the car. Her gaze rested presently upon an
elderly woman whose face was eminently
kindly. She was every inch a matron. Mrs.
Estelle Sansone stepped over to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me,” she said, “but the lady over
there is quite ill, and she is worrying about her
little boy, who should have been back by this
time. I don’t like to leave her alone while I go
in search—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” broke in the other, “you want some
one to take your place? I thank you for asking
me. I’ve been a widow for nearly fourteen
years, and since my husband’s death I
have worked as nurse in the Northwestern
Railroad’s emergency ward in Chicago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I couldn’t have made a better
choice,” cried Mrs. Sansone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my first real pleasure trip—mine and
my daughter’s—since my widowhood,” continued
the woman, “but the pleasures of travel
are as nothing compared with waiting on any
good woman in distress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The introductions were quickly made, and
Mrs. Sansone left the car, feeling that Barbara
was in hands better far than her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked about the station. The clock
indicated that in about five minutes the train
would start. Mrs. Sansone grew anxious.
She hurried along the platform, looking
eagerly on every side for some sign of the children.
A glance towards the beach rewarded
her searching. Peggy, her hair streaming in
the wind, was running towards her. Mrs. Sansone’s
heart sank. Where was the boy? A
sense of calamity seized her. She too ran to
meet the child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother, mother!” cried Peggy, throwing
her arms about Mrs. Sansone and bursting
into a new agony of grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest,” crooned Mrs. Sansone, raising
the child to her bosom, “tell me! What has
become of Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother! I am afraid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell the truth, darling. No matter what—it
is your mother who listens. She will
understand; she will not scold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby is drowned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, blessed Mary!” cried Mrs. Sansone,
restoring Peggy to the sands and clasping her
hands in dismay. “I can’t believe it! Tell
me, dear, how it happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby was wading, and he was trying to
be obedient. He got out too far, and I reminded
him of his promise to his mother. And
he said he was going to keep his promise. And
just while he was talking to me a big roller
came on him—you see, his back was turned—and
that roller knocked him down and pulled
him out, and when I looked—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Peggy fell to weeping again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, dear? Tell me quick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And were there none around to go to his
help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did you call for help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mother. I just ran away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you said nothing, dearest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I was afraid they would think I was
a murderer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sansone had long walked the paths
of wisdom. She knew how common it was
for little children, witnesses to a drowning or
a like calamity, to fly from the scene and in
fear keep silent. She understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were frightened, dearest. If you
were older, you would have called for help.
But you are not to blame. God help us! Now,
Peggy, come with me. Or stay—I must break
the news to his poor mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And tell her,” said Peggy sobbingly, “that
his last words were how he must always keep
his promises, especially those he made to his
mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mrs. Sansone wept. It was a bitter
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All aboard!” cried one of the trainmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy and her mother were just in time to
mount the platform when the train started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, with love and pity and all manner
of gentleness, Mrs. Sansone told the pitiful
story. When the full horror of it was grasped
by Barbara, she asked for her crucifix, gazed
upon it fixedly for several seconds, kissed it,
and fell into a faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then it was that all that was matronly shone
forth in Mrs. Feehan. Then it was that she
and Mrs. Sansone, never for a moment neglecting
the sick woman, mingled their tears and
their grief. The porter, the gayest, chattiest
porter in that section of the Pullman service,
was their willing slave. He too became a partner
in their sorrow. In fact, every passenger
on the car and every employee of the road on
duty duly caught the spirit of sympathy, and
before Barbara came to, dry-eyed and almost
despairing, lines and telephones were busy in
a vain endeavor to get any possible light on
the drowning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” cried Barbara when she became fully
conscious of the dark tragedy, “I must go
back! I cannot go on without my boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conductor was summoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can let you off, lady,” he explained.
“But I doubt whether you can get any means
of returning at this point. Besides, when we
arrive at the next station, we may expect an
answer concerning the child. In that way you
will get word quicker than if you were to return
at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Vernon,” urged the nurse, “it would
be the worst thing you could do to return.
You are physically unfit just now to walk or
make any kind of exertion. You need several
hours of complete rest. If you take my advice,
you will go on and not attempt to leave
the car until the shock has passed and your
strength returns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must go back—I must!” cried Barbara
hysterically. As she spoke she suddenly
rose and took a few quick steps. But the effort
was too much. She staggered, and despite
her efforts fell back into the arms of
the kind matron.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>But Bobby was not drowned. Peggy and
he, as the wave caught him, were not alone.
Seated on the ledge of a cliff, hidden almost
completely from view, a bather, tall and
plump, once a professional life-saver, had been
watching the two children carefully. He had
noted the roller even before Peggy. He was
at a considerable distance from the children;
but as Peggy turned to fly he was dashing, diagonally,
across the beach. It was nothing for
him, tall and strong of limb, to plunge into
the water, to reach the very spot where Bobby
had disappeared, and when Bobby’s head came
to the surface, to take a few strong strokes,
reach the unconscious boy, and bring him almost
without effort to the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, I say, was unconscious; and the rescuer,
for a moment, doubted whether the little
lad was alive. Paying no attention, therefore,
to the fleeing Peggy, the man, experienced
in such matters, endeavored to restore the
lad to consciousness. Bobby had swallowed
much salt water. It was the work of a few
moments to remedy that trouble. Then the
man put himself to the task of getting the boy
to breathe. In the shade of the cliff he labored
long and arduously. Almost a quarter of an
hour passed before Bobby’s face showed the
slightest sign of life. Eventually he began to
breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, boy! you’re doing fine,” cried the
man. “Come on now, and wake up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adjured in such like terms at least twenty
times, Bobby at length opened his eyes upon
a world which he had almost left for good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howdy, Johnny? Are you awake?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby looked gravely at his companion and,
the inspection completed, asked, as he closed
his eyes again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right here at Long Beach,” came the answer.
“Here, let me put my coat about you.
You look pretty cold. How do you feel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess so,” answered Bobby, not even
opening his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the rescuer took the child, wrapped as
he was in the heavy coat, and folded him to his
bosom. He held the boy tight. Bobby soon
began to warm up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where am I?” he inquired once more, opening
his eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told you we were at Long Beach, didn’t
I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you did. Say, didn’t you pull me
out of the water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, and not a second too soon, either.
Now look here, Johnny. The color is coming
back to your face. But you must get that
chill out of you. Here, you must stretch your
legs. Take my hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby at first was barely able to walk. But
gradually his strength returned, his strength
and his smile. But neither lasted long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say! I’m getting so tired!” he remarked
after a few quick turns. “Would you mind if
I lie down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laid Bobby down upon the sands,
once more wrapping him, as he did so, tightly
in the coat. Bobby promptly turned on his
side and, resting his head upon his right arm,
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My!” apostrophized the man, after a long
contemplation. “I never saw such an interesting
face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say something, sir?” asked Bobby,
opening his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said a mouthful,” came the answer. “But
look you, boy; you are weaker than you ought
to be. What you need is brandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t drink,” objected Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of us drink just now, for that matter,”
the man dryly observed. “Just the same,
you need a bit of brandy. Now will you remain
here till I come back? I may be gone ten
or fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just now, sir, I don’t want to go anywhere.
Oh, I’ll stay, all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bobby meant it. Nevertheless he did
not stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man had hardly disappeared from view
when Bobby sat up and stretched himself.
Then he arose and went through the same
process. Bobby was feeling once more that he
was alive. Throwing off the coat, he quickly
put on his proper garments, already perfectly
dry. Then Bobby bethought him of his shoes.
It would be easy to recover them and return
within a few minutes. Accordingly, with his
light step and easy grace quite restored, he
trotted along the shore; and even as he moved,
the events that had led up to his mischance
began to return to his memory—the horrified
eyes of Peggy, the big wave coming upon him,
and then? What was it happened next? At
the moment he could recall no more. Seating
himself, he put on shoes and stockings, when
all of a sudden as he arose, the awful memory,
unbidden, returned. Once more he felt the
waves’ might, once more he felt himself whirled
and tossed about like a cork, once more he
choked as the water forced itself into his gaping
mouth. Here his memory ended. Bobby was
more frightened by the memory than he had
been by the actual happening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just then, when the horror of it all had
seized upon him, the ground beneath his feet
began to oscillate. This was the last straw.
Bobby could bear no more. The sea but a short
time before had tried to swallow him up; now
it was the land itself that would devour him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Utterly panic-stricken, urged on by a blind
instinct in which reason had no share, the little
fellow ran at a speed born of fear away
from that awful beach. As it happened, there
were stairs at that point leading up to the cliff.
Bobby took them two at a time. Ocean Avenue
was thronged just then with people,
strangers in California, who failed, naturally
enough, to see anything of humor in an earthquake.
Under normal circumstances Bobby,
flying at full speed along a highway, would
have attracted more than a little attention.
But the circumstances were not normal, and
the fear which urged Bobby onwards was the
same fear which in a measure possessed nearly
all of those whom with flying feet he passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby had always been a good runner. On
this occasion he surpassed himself. On he
went until he was alone on the open road; on
past orchards of oranges, peaches, lemons,
pears and plums. The ground at every step
was, as he felt, growing firmer beneath his
feet; and once away from the outskirts of
Ocean Beach he began to slacken his pace. It
was then that the sharp tooting of a horn behind
him caused him to turn; an automobile
was bearing down upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, putting on full speed once more,
darted to the left side of the road, which at this
point sharply curved, only to find another machine
bearing upon him swiftly from the opposite
direction. There seemed to be no chance
of escape. Nevertheless Bobby jumped for his
life, landing on hands and knees at the side
of the road, while the oncoming machine, now
fairly upon him, swung desperately away. It
passed within an inch of the boy’s feet as he
flew through the air. Bobby did not arise.
He collapsed where he had fallen. The machine
which had nearly done for him came to a
halt full thirty yards up the road, where from
it descended a highly excited young man, who,
more than emulating Bobby’s burst of speed,
ran quickly and picked up the lad in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, little fellow, you’re not hurt, are you?
Now don’t say you’re hurt. It was a close
call, but I never touched you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Bobby’s head hung limp, his eyes remained
closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man grew pale with fear. Possibly he
had frightened the child to death. Gazing
with extreme compassion upon the delicate features
of the sensitive face, he groaned aloud
and, as though his burden weighed nothing,
sprinted back to his machine. There he laid
the boy on the front seat, and, getting out a
water bottle from the tonneau, removed the
stopper and dashed a goodly portion of water
into the child’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effect was immediate. Bobby sat up,
and looking into the frightened face of his
new aggressor, opened his mouth and bawled.
Bobby, to do him justice, was a manly little
fellow, and manly little fellows of seven or
eight are not in the habit of bawling. But
he had been through a fearful series of ordeals.
He was no longer himself. Panic had entered
into his very soul. The sea had tried to get
him; the earth, lining itself up with the sea,
had shaken beneath his feet; and when he ran
from one automobile, another had borne down
upon him to such effect that only by a marvel
short of the miraculous had he escaped with
his life. So Bobby went on bawling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This exhibition of tears and lungs had a very
disconcerting effect on the young man. He
was, as the reader has a right to know, John
Compton, a promising comedian, engaged recently
by a moving-picture company, the head
members of which counted upon his becoming
shortly one of the leading film comedians of
the country. On that very day he had started
in upon his second picture. But an hour before
he had rehearsed part of the opening
scene; and he would have still been rehearsing
at that very moment had it not happened that
the property man was not on time with the
completion of an indoor set; as a consequence
of which the director had called off further rehearsal
till two o’clock that afternoon. Not
thinking it worth his while to disturb his make-up,
John Compton had jumped into his automobile
and gone out for a spin, with his face
painted a sickly yellow and eyebrows fiercely
exaggerated. Bobby had never before seen
a moving-picture actor in his war paint. No
wonder that he continued to bawl; no wonder
that he refused to be comforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton was at his wits’ end. It was
useless to advise the boy to calm himself. To
be heard Compton would be obliged to bellow
at the top of his voice. And why not? It
was an inspiration. Standing outside his own
machine, John Compton planted his hands
upon his knees, and stooping till his face was
on a level with Bobby’s, opened his mouth, a
not inconsiderable one, and bawled, too, with
all the energy of desperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the awful sound Bobby, opening his eyes
to their widest, ceased his outcries and, with
his mouth still wide open, stared in incredulous
amazement at John Compton. This gentleman,
having stopped momentarily for
breath, started his strange performance once
more. But there was a different tone to the
second attempt. Mr. Compton, gaining courage
through success, was beginning to perceive
a certain humor in the situation; and into his
bawling went that sense of humor. The suspicion
of a grin came upon the boy’s face. Inspired
by this, Compton entered upon a third
attempt, which really succeeded in being a
clever caricature of Bobby’s bawling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never say die,” said the comedian, smiling
pleasantly and winking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so!” returned Bob, and reproduced
to a nicety Compton’s identical wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton’s perplexity was entirely gone.
He liked Bobby from the first; but with that
wink he loved him. So, light of heart, John
Compton forced his features into the exaggerated
smile which, in the opinion of his director,
would, when once known, be worth a
fortune, and Bobby for the first time since the
roller came upon him burst into a laugh, clear,
silvery—sweeter, dearer at that moment to
Compton than all the music that had ever
charmed his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey! Do it again,” cried Bobby, standing
up and wearing an air of seraphic joy. Mr.
Compton accepted the encore gratefully, but
lost his great smile almost instantaneously
when Bobby, allowing for a smaller mouth and
more delicate features, reproduced the million-dollar
grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word!” exclaimed the thoroughly
amazed comedian. “I must say I like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, I like you very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I like you very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name, little screecher?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby Vernon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that name very much. Mine is John
Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I like that name very much. Say,
come in and sit with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment. Where are you from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cincinnati.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton, starting slightly, looked at the
boy’s features searchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Bobby, what was your mother’s
maiden name—her name before she was married,
you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barbara Carberry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton buried his face in his hands. When
he raised his head presently, he discovered
Bobby weeping. Stepping into the car,
Compton took Bobby in his arms and, gazing
once more upon the child’s face, stooped
over and kissed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew your mother once,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you like her?” asked Bobby eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like her! That’s no name for it. Tell
me all about her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the thought of his mother that had
set Bobby to weeping again. No wonder, then,
that as he proceeded to recount the events of
that morning he was forced sobbing to halt in
his narration several times until he had mastered
his grief. No child in deep trouble ever had a
more sympathetic listener. While Bobby went
on with his tale of woe, Compton, deeply attentive,
was speeding at the rate of forty-five
miles an hour for Los Angeles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” he had explained to Bobby, “if I
don’t hurry, I’ll be late for that two o’clock
rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped once on the road at a telephone
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby,” he said when he had returned from
the booth, “I’ve made inquiries. Your mother
took sick. They say there was an earthquake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say there was! Didn’t I tell you
how it started me to running till I ran into
you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true. In fact, I believe there was
an earthquake. Seems to me I noticed one
myself; but I was so busy thinking about my
part in the new production that I didn’t pay
much attention to it. Well, anyhow, it made
your mother sick. It often does affect strangers
that way. And they brought her to her
car; and before she knew what happened I
reckon the old train started off to bring her to
San Luis Obispo without you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s sensitive upper lip quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, now, don’t you cry. I’ve sent a telegram
which will catch her at San Luis Obispo,
telling her that you are with me and that I
will keep you safe and sound till I hear from
her. Cheer up, Bobby! You’ll get word to-morrow.
There’s nothing to worry about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton was a bad prophet. Bobby
did not get word. In fact, owing to the flood
of telegrams consequent upon the earthquake,
Compton’s message was delayed nearly twenty-four
hours, and though it duly reached San
Luis Obispo it was never delivered. Barbara
Vernon was not there to receive it.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MRS. VERNON ALL BUT ABANDONS HOPE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>John Compton had vainly attempted to get
any details in regard to Bobby’s rescue.
It had been a bad day for swimmers at Long
Beach. The waters had been unusually rough,
and in consequence several bathers were
drowned and nearly a score in imminent danger
rescued. Over the telephone he got a complete
list of those whom the life-savers had
brought safely in, but in that list was no name
in any wise corresponding with that of Bobby
Vernon. Had not the earthquake come along
at the wrong moment, Bobby would not, unconsciously
breaking his promise, have run
away, and Mrs. Vernon would not have been
whisked into the Pullman and been borne
northward on the wings of steam. No; Bobby
would have waited and Mrs. Vernon would
have remained. They would have come together
very shortly, and this story would not,
failing that earthquake, be worth the writing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor would Mrs. Vernon have gone on toward
San Luis Obispo utterly broken in spirit.
In reply to telegrams and long-distance telephone
calls made by Mrs. Sansone and the
big-hearted nurse, they learned that no boy
corresponding to hers had been rescued, and
that it was impossible at the moment to give
any adequate report of those who had met
death in the angry waters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Bobby’s rescuer, when he returned to
the beach and failed to find the boy awaiting
him, he was highly disgusted. The boy had
broken his promise and gone off without so
much as a word of thanks. Being a native, so
to speak, it did not occur to him that an earthquake
might put a lone little lad into a panic.
Meditating grimly on the ungratefulness of
mankind in general and of a certain small boy
in particular, he turned himself with a glum
face to the bathing house. He was already
long overdue in the city, and putting the incident
out of his mind as an unpleasant memory,
he went his way, telling no man of his morning’s
adventure. Thus it came about that
Bobby’s rescue was recorded only in heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus too it came about that Barbara Vernon
gave up all hope of her son’s having been
rescued. He was dead, and she was alone in
the world. In vain did Mrs. Sansone beg her
to hope; equally in vain did Mrs. Feehan fold
her to her generous heart and whisper in her
ear those sweet nothings which love makes
more valuable in such circumstances than
pearls of great price. Mrs. Vernon, dry-eyed
and with set face, speaking nothing, apparently
hearing nothing, gazed into vacancy.
Even Mrs. Feehan, whose hope was as strong
as her love, began to lose courage. Something
must be done or the poor bereaved widow
might go mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resigning the unhappy lady to the care of
the Italian, Mrs. Feehan walked through the
car, scanning quickly the face of each passenger.
Disappointed in her inspection, she
went into the next car, and as she entered, the
smile returned to her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated in a section near her entry was a
venerable priest. His thick spectacles failed
to conceal the kindly old eyes; while the large,
red, weather-beaten face seemed somehow to
tell the tale of myriad deeds of consolation and
kindness. To look upon him with unprejudiced
eyes was by way of loving him. He was
sitting with folded hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father,” exclaimed the nurse, “pardon
me for disturbing you. But there is a woman
in the next car who, I fear, will go mad unless
some one can reach her. She is a widow, and
her only boy has just been drowned. She is
a devout Catholic, and I am almost certain
that if any one can bring her out of her
despair a Catholic priest can do it. I’ve
dealt with a number of like cases, and I
know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest arose, and, as Mrs. Feehan observed,
slipped his beads, concealed in his
folded hands, into his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll talk to her, my good woman, and while
I talk, do you pray.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they entered the car the porter met them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find the lady in the drawing-room.
I put her in there myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a trump!” said the priest, patting
the porter on the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon, as they entered, was showing
once more some signs of improvement. She
was gazing not without a touch of tenderness
down upon the tear-stained, almost despairing
face of the beautiful little child Peggy, who
on her knees was imploring forgiveness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry, Mrs. Vernon. I lost my wits.
But do forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s as good a girl as I know,” said the
priest. “How are you, Peggy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father Galligan, ask her to forgive
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what it’s all about,” said the
priest, “but I’m sure little Peggy would not
wilfully do anything wrong. As you expect
God’s help, my dear lady, in this trying hour,
send this child away in peace and quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon raised herself up and threw
her arms about the little one’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing to forgive, little dear. But
pray, pray for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, madam,” observed the priest, “that
if ever you were fit to receive all that comes
with the blessing of the Church now is the
time. Here, Peggy, kneel down and pray;
and you too, Mrs. Sansone. And you too,” he
added, addressing himself to the nurse;
“though I’m thinking that Peggy’s prayers are
worth all yours and mine put together. Now,
speed her up, Peggy, while I recite the Gospel
of St. John.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, in all seriousness, an exquisite
prayer-meeting. If angels can be influenced
by human beauty, delicate innocence, and the
awful faith of childhood, legions of them must
have pressed about the great White Throne to
tell the wondrous tale of Peggy’s praying. It
is doubtful, also, whether they could have been
insensible to the ardent petitions of the nurse
and Peggy’s mother. However this may be,
one thing is certain: the authorized prayer of
a priest uttered in the name of the Church has
an efficacy behind it which pierces high heaven.
Such a prayer goes flying upward, winged by
the power of that Church, in whose name it is
uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Father Galligan, closing his
little book and gesturing the suppliants to rise
from their knees, “you may all go outside and
talk about your neighbors; and the more you
talk about them the better—provided you
speak of their good qualities. This lady is going
to entertain me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ve all got to go now anyhow,”
said Mrs. Sansone. “Los Angeles is our home,
and Mrs. Feehan with her dear little daughter
is stopping to visit a relation—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you say the word, Father,” put in
Mrs. Feehan, “I’ll go on and see Mrs. Vernon
through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it will be necessary,” said the
Father. “Take your holiday and God bless
you all. And don’t you forget, Peggy, to go
to communion every day you can. You need
it, dear child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed I won’t forget, Father. Good-by,
Mrs. Vernon. You are just lovely, and I’ll
pray for you every day and for Bobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Peggy left the compartment the priest
lightly laid his hand on the child’s raven-black
hair and blessed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor child!” he remarked to Mrs. Vernon.
“She’s as lovely now and as good as an angel.
But she has the fatal gift of beauty, and she’s
going to grow up. Lovely, untainted children—and
the world is full of them—quite upset
me. I don’t want them to die and I don’t want
them to grow up. Confound original sin anyway!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure my little boy is in heaven. But I
am a mother. Oh, how I want him! I can’t
give him up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know what you can do. None of
us knows till we try. Remember, there is a
faith that moves mountains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much, Father,” said Mrs.
Vernon. “A moment ago I was tempted to
take my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure the angels didn’t notice it, and so
it won’t go on the recording book. You have
had a great sorrow. But listen to the words of
an old priest who has spent his priestly life of
forty-three years supping with sorrow—other
people’s mainly. When God sends us a great
sorrow, He sends us a great strength, if we
will only accept it. And more: if we bear our
sorrows in simple faith, somehow, somewhere,
God will turn our sorrow into joy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Father, He can never give me back my
son!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that,” demurred the Father,
taking a pinch of snuff. “Didn’t Christ
say, ‘Out of these stones I can raise up children
to Abraham?’ Never say can’t when you’re
talking about God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see, Father; you want of me the deepest
faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly, my good woman, the faith that
moves mountains. ‘Earth has no sorrow that
heaven cannot heal.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father, I will try.” As she finished these
words, Mrs. Vernon fell to weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good for you!” commented the priest.
“What alarmed me most when I first saw you
was the fact of your being so dry-eyed. But
let us talk about something else. You don’t
belong out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Father. I come from Cincinnati. My
name is Barbara Vernon. Almost two years
ago I lost my husband. He died a good death;
but he was a poor business man, and the thing
that bothered him most at his last hour was
that he had neglected to renew his life insurance.
It lapsed just two weeks before the
day of his death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An artist, possibly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you might call him so, Father.
He was an actor, and, if God had given him
a longer life, would have become a playwright.
He was engaged on the third and last act of
a play when he took sick. I am confident, not
only on my own judgment, but on the authority
of several critics, that had he lived to complete
it he would have made a fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These artists are all alike,” commented the
priest. “They see everything in the heavens
above and the waters under the earth but their
own interests. They all die uninsured—most
of them, anyhow. But what brings you out
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hope of straightening out my affairs.
You see, my husband, on the strength of his
play, borrowed twenty-five hundred dollars on
a note which falls due September the first. I
want to pay it. I feel it is my duty. He borrowed
from a friend who now needs the money.
I have been teaching elocution to private pupils
ever since my husband’s death, and have
managed to put aside seven hundred dollars.
Three months ago it became clear to me that
I could not possibly get the full amount together.
Now, there happens to live in San
Luis Obispo a wealthy relation of mine, an
uncle whom I have not seen since I was a little
girl. He was very fond of me then, and he
more than once asked me to call on him if I
were ever in trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did very well to come, Mrs. Vernon.
He lives, you say, in San Luis Obispo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I know him. I spent three years
at San Luis. In fact, I was there all of last
year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His name, Father, is Pedro Alvarez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The start which the priest gave was almost
imperceptible. Not for nothing had he heard
over four hundred thousand confessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know him, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is he well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am just wondering,” mused the priest
evasively, “whether he has much money. He
was wealthy once, but he lost heavily on some
oil investments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is he well, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is two months,” pursued the priest, “since
I was in residence at San Luis Obispo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment the train stopped at a small
station, and there was heard a commotion without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something wrong, I fear,” said the
Father, glad of an opportunity to change the
subject. He now regretted that he had bidden
Mrs. Feehan take her holiday at Los
Angeles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reverend,” said the porter, entering suddenly,
“there’s a man at the station who’s been
injured by a freight, and he is calling for a
priest. He may die any moment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me,” said Father Galligan, rising
quickly. “When I come back I have something
to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Galligan did not return. The dying
man needed him, and Mrs. Vernon saw the
priest no more. He only came and went, and
touched her life into a higher faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening Mrs. Vernon stepped off the
car at San Luis Obispo. The station was almost
deserted. However, she had little trouble
in getting information about Alvarez, once
very prominent in the city. He was dead. He
had died seven months before almost penniless
and prepared by Father Galligan. This it was
that Father Galligan had intended telling her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train, while Mrs. Vernon was getting
this information, departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor woman was almost beside herself.
Wringing her hands, she paced up and down
the deserted platform, calling upon the Mother
of Sorrows to come to her aid. Five minutes
or more passed when she was interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Miss,” said a plainly
dressed man to whose hands were clinging a
girl of twelve and a boy who evidently was her
younger brother; “but do you know anything
about nursing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s face was troubled and eager.
The two children had been recently crying.
Indeed, so it seemed to Mrs. Vernon, it had
been a day of calamity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I took nearly two years’ course of training.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried the girl, breaking into a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then for the love of God, come to my help.
My wife will die unless she gets good nursing.
The doctor has said it. Look at these two
children. Think of them without a mother.
I’m a ranchman living thirty miles from here.
Money is no object. Name your own terms.
I know you won’t refuse. All afternoon I’ve
looked and looked for a nurse. Before you say
no, look at these little ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please!” cried the girl, clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!” entreated the boy, catching her
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Could the Mother of Sorrows have sent
them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly know how to refuse you, sir; but
my own little boy has this day been taken
from me by drowning, carried out by the undertow
at Long Beach. I was not with him
at the time, and I must go back and find
whether his body has been recovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ranchman took a careful and appraising
look at Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” he said, “I think I understand.
I know how you feel. But let me make a suggestion.
You are in no condition to return to
Long Beach; nor would you know what to do
when you got there. Now, I’m familiar with
the place and the conditions. I have, in fact,
some influence there. Now I’ll tell you what
I’ll do. If for the sake of saving my dear
wife’s life you will come with me, I’ll take you
at once to our home and will return in time to
get the next train to Long Beach. And I
promise you that I will do all that you could
do and more, to learn anything, however
trivial it may seem, concerning your boy. Oh,
madam, for the love of God, give your consent.
I am sure He has sent you to us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, ma’am,” implored the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mama needs you,” added the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In God’s name!” said the ranchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking everything into consideration, Barbara
Vernon could not resist these sweet children,
this fond husband, and so a few minutes
later she was on her way in the ranchman’s
machine to enter upon a new phase of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus it fell that when the telegram from John
Compton reached San Luis Obispo the following
afternoon no claimant for it could be discovered.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A NEW WAY OF BREAKING INTO THE MOVIES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Your true cloister of to-day is a moving-picture
studio. The sign “No Admittance,”
or some wording of similar meaning,
greets the stranger at every door. There is,
too, at each entry a dragon on guard, sometimes
in the guise of a gracious but firm young
woman, sometimes, it may be, in that of a forbidding
old man; but no matter how various be
the form of these dragons, they are there to
see that you don’t go in. To enter without the
Open Sesame incurs an excommunication seldom
incurred, for the reason that the dragons
are always on duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As John Compton, holding the hand of
Bobby, made to enter the sacred precincts of
the Lantry Studio at the entryway provided
for the actors, the man on guard cast a severe
and forbidding look at the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know my orders,” he grumbled, still
gazing at Bobby while addressing Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I do. But this boy is an aunt of mine—er—that
is, an uncle. Oh, dash it! what am
I talking about? He’s my little nephew,
Bobby Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get it right?” observed a
bright young lady, one of the “stars,” as she
passed through the sacred gate. “Don’t you
think, on second thought, Mr. Compton, that
he’s your grandfather? He looks more like
that than an aunt of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surly keeper of the gate perceived the
joke. It was on record that he had seen
through a joke on three distinct occasions
during his two years of guardianship. To-day
he scored for the fourth time. Bobby as an
aunt was really funny. But as a grandfather!
The keeper dropped his pipe and lost his
scowl, and holding up both hands, palms
outward, roared with laughter. He was still
in the throes of his mammoth mirth when
Compton pushed through the stile—I know no
better word for it—and drew Bobby after him.
The cloister was violated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Bobby had by this time wearied of
holding Compton’s hand. Moreover he had
noticed a certain peculiarity in Compton’s
walk which he desired to study to better advantage.
So, loosening his hold, and saying, “I’ll
follow you,” he dropped behind his newly-discovered
uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton, dressed for his part in the rehearsal,
wore a nondescript jacket and a vest
of startling color. Into the armholes of this
vest his thumbs were thrust, the free fingers
of his hand extended and waving in unison
at each step. Bobby had already studied
this peculiarity. Now he was to study the
secret of Compton’s strides. They were, to
begin with, notably long strides. But most
striking of all was the part his feet played.
The right foot at each step was turned in, the
left out. In justice to Mr. Compton, this was
not his proper gait. He was practicing for
his part. Bobby, however, liked it. In fact,
he liked anything connected with John
Compton, and because John Compton did it
Bobby saw nothing funny in it at all. It was
easy for Bobby to insert his real thumbs into
imaginary armholes and to wiggle his fingers
with each step. It was not so easy, by reason
of the shortness of his legs, for Bobby to catch
his uncle’s stride. But he thought it worth
while, and he did it. Then Bobby, with surprisingly
little difficulty, got his feet to working
as though one were going in one direction
and the other in another; and so serenely moved
on the procession of two, a spectacle for angels
and Miss Bernadette Vivian, the young star
who had brought to life once more the gate-keeper’s
sense of humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Bernadette’s turn to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” she cried to a busy and jaded-looking
official, who was hurrying past her with a
sheaf of papers in his hands and a lead pencil
in his mouth. “Set your eyes on that boy.
That’s Compton’s aunt or grandfather—he’s
not quite clear which—and of the two, I think,
with all respect to Compton, the aunt is the better
comedian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official looked and grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you’re right,” he observed, removing
the pencil from his mouth. “You’re working
with Compton. Keep your eye on the kid.
We may need him if he’s not engaged already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on here, Bobby; you take my hand,”
said Compton, turning sharply and detecting
his understudy in action. Another man might
have been annoyed, Compton was tickled
beyond measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Threading their way through a maze of sets
and scenery, among which busy men—carpenters,
electricians, secretaries and what
not—were winding in what appeared to be inextricable
confusion, they finally arrived at a
set arranged to represent the lobby of a hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the left was a cigar counter, and beyond
it an exit, or, possibly, an entryway to some
other part of the hotel. The rest, save for a
bellhop’s bench, was space. Seated or lounging
about were several actors; among them a
young lady dressed as a salesgirl; a boy of
about Bobby’s size, though evidently several
years older, gay in the buttons and livery of a
bellhop; a young man in society clothes; and
finally a young woman who was evidently a
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hurrying from one to the other of these and
speaking quickly certain instructions, was a
young man whose intense face expressed
infinite patience and strong, though jaded,
energy. He was tired—had been tired for six
months—but had no time to diagnose the
symptoms. This was the stage director, Mr.
Joseph Heneman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halloa, John! Glad you’ve come. Everything’s
set, and we’re going to move like a
house afire. Who’s that fine little boy with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m his aunt,” said Bobby seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heneman nearly exploded on the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You young screech-owl!” said Compton,
turning a severe face, though his eyes
twinkled, upon Bobby. “Who taught you how
to lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said I was your aunt,” countered
Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your uncle—nephew, I mean. This young
monkey,” he went on, addressing the manager,
the vision of Bobby’s latest mimicry
still vivid in his memory, “is my nephew,
Bobby Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I didn’t know you had a nephew,”
said Heneman, still laughing. As he spoke he
shook hands with the interesting youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither did I till a while ago,” chuckled
Compton. “Fact is I adopted him and christened
him on the way in. It’s a long story, but
he’s in my charge now. He’ll sit still and
watch us working. Won’t you, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll watch you working all right,” said
Compton’s new relation. Bobby had no intention
of sitting still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halloa, aunty!” said Bernadette, suddenly
appearing on the scene, and smiling at Bobby,
showing in the act a perfect and shining set of
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” returned Bobby, bowing
gravely. “You’ve got it wrong, though. He’s
my uncle. He says so himself, and he ought to
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the rehearsal began every one there
heard the story from the fair lady’s cupid-painted
lips of the circumstances connected
with Bobby’s admission into the Lantry cloister.
The story filled with joy all the listeners
save one. The bellhop did not even smile.
The fact is, the bellhop, yielding to a long-fought
temptation, had obtained a quid of
tobacco from a stage carpenter, had indulged
in his first and probably his last chew, and was
just now filled with feelings of wild regret and
a desire to lie down in some obscure spot and
die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of Bernadette’s story every one,
excepting of course the unhappy bellhop, was
in a state of almost hilarious good humor when
the rehearsal was called; in such humor that
even when the star halted everything for
several minutes by insisting that one of her
shoes was improperly laced—though to the
naked eye there was nothing out of order—and
having her attendant do it all over again,
no one grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Heneman had counted on going on with
the rehearsal “like a house afire.” He had
reckoned without his host, and the host was the
bellhop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going further it may be well to
observe that a picture in the making is far from
resembling a picture in the viewing. The
former is a very slow process. It may require
a whole day to produce what one sees on the
screen in three or four seconds. Before the
camera men “shoot” there may be a dozen or
more rehearsals; and the shooting may be repeated
seven or eight times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready!” cried Mr. Heneman. “Positions!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word the salesgirl got behind the
cigar counter and, to make everybody understand
that she was only a salesgirl, proceeded
to chew gum violently. In real life saleswomen
sometimes do chew gum; but it is rare
to discover one who makes it an almost violent
physical exercise. Standing to the right of the
saleslady—in the lobby—the young man in the
dresscoat, facing the young lady with not
enough clothes on her back to make a bookmark,
began offering such original remarks as
the state of the weather generally evokes.
Back of them all, in an alcove near the exit,
sat the bellhop, gloom and desolation upon his
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, you! Don’t stand so the lady can’t
be seen. Let the lady turn a little to the right.
That’s it. Go on and talk, both of you, and
smile as if you were each saying awfully witty
things. Bellhop, hold up your head! You look
like a drowned rat. Look tough; you’re looking
dismal.” Here the director paused, and
while the camera men were placing their machines
in position, and their assistants were arranging
reflectors, and an electrician, perched
on high above the shooting line, arranged a
powerful light over the head of the salesgirl,
he went over to the bellhop, showed him how
to sit, how to hold his hands, cross his legs and
drop one corner of his mouth. There was
some improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, once more!” ordered the director.
“Positions! Smile, you two. Talk, talk!
Don’t overdo that chewing-gum stuff. Give a
yawn, bellhop. Good! Now come on,
Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From off scene to the right enters Compton.
He is befuddled with liquor, and on his face is
an expression of utmost stupidity. It is doubtful,
indeed, if any live human being could be
as stupid as he looked. In his right hand he is
balancing a cane with a crook. His walk is a
marvel of indecision. He hasn’t the least idea,
apparently, as to whither he is going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, just back of the director, is watching
all this with breathless interest. Previous to
Compton’s entrance he had assumed the attitude
and pose of the “lady,” arms akimbo,
head thrown back and a full smile. Upon
Compton’s appearance Bobby could at first
hardly restrain the exuberance of his delight.
The highest admiration often expresses itself
in imitation. To the amazement and amusement
of several actors stationed behind him,
the lad with scarcely an effort threw his
features into a close replica of Compton’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s as good a nut as Compton,” observed
an old actor to a companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so!” rejoined the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton almost jostled the young lady in
his onward progress. As it was, the crook of
his cane caught upon her elbow and hung there.
Without his cane, Compton showed a dim
consciousness of feeling that something was
wrong. He felt his clothes, his pockets, his
face, and then looking for the nonce dimly intelligent,
turned around, removed the cane
from its improvised hook, raised his hat,
dropped it, stooped to get the cane, picked it
up, reached for his hat, dropped the cane, and
so on. It was simple fun, but made worth
while by the manner of the actor. Bobby by
this time had a stick and a hat, and without
knowing it was giving a capital performance
for the exclusive benefit of sixteen actors and
several outsiders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, salesgirl!” ordered Heneman, “call
the bellhop, and tell him to request with all
possible politeness the gentleman in liquor to
leave the premises.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bellhop came at her call, received her
message, and strode towards Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get back there and do it again!” bawled the
director. “You walk as though you were going
to church or to your grandmother’s funeral.
Turn your shoulders in, drop your mouth,
swing your arms. Just imagine you’re going
to lick somebody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bellhop tried again, with no sign of improvement.
Again and again he failed. No
moving-picture actor in that studio, it is
probable, ever received such minute directions.
But they were all lost on him. However, they
were not lost on Bobby. Utterly unconscious
of the attention he was exciting, Bobby was
following out to the letter every hint coming
from Heneman’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the spectators was a wag. The parts
he always figured in were tragic or romantic
roles, but in real life he was the most notorious
practical joker in the Lantry Studio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, Johnny,” he said, whispering into
the boy’s ear. “Would you like to do an act
of kindness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been watching you for some time. You
know how that bellhop should do his part. Go
and show him. It’s no use telling him how.
He doesn’t understand. But you just go and
show him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it be all right?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An act of kindness is always right,”
answered the wag, with tragic solemnity.
“Look; he’s starting now, and he’s worse than
ever. Don’t tell any one I suggested your
showing him. Keep it a dead secret. Now,
go to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In perfect good faith Bobby stepped
forward, passed the director, saying as he
went, “Excuse me, sir,” and ignoring Compton
and the “lady” and “gentleman,” strode
over to the bellhop. All this, happening
though it did in a few seconds, produced an
unheard-of effect. The saleslady stopped
chewing, the lady and gentleman ceased smiling,
Compton looked surprised and intelligent,
the director let his jaw drop, and the audience,
now swollen to double its size, pressed forward
to the cameras. The bellhop himself put on a
human expression of inquiry. As Bobby came
face to face with the victim every one on the
stage seemed to be momentarily paralyzed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor fish,” said Bob, kindness and
energy ringing in his accents, “just let me
show you. It’s so easy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bellhop sank back into his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now look,” continued Bobby. The left-hand
corner of his mouth sagged, his shoulders
bent in, and with a walk and a swerve redolent
of the old Bowery, Bobby advanced towards
Compton, whose eyes were protruding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You boob!” announced Bobby. “You are
politely requested to make a noise like a train
and rattle out of here. Get me?” And as
Bobby, not in the way of kindness, laid his
hand on Compton, cheers and laughter and
hand-clapping disturbed scandalously the quiet
of the Lantry cloister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, nothing disconcerted, bowed, laying
his hand over his heart, and smiled affably.
But when the star, Bernadette, came running
over, her face beaming with delight, and exclaimed,
“Aunty, I’m going to kiss you for
that,” he blanched and fled to Compton’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause and a deliberation.
Compton and the manager conferred together
for five minutes. The result of their talk was
that Bobby was hired on the spot and the
victim of tobacco given a vacation till further
notice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus did Bobby Vernon “break into the
movies.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BOBBY ENDEAVORS TO SHOW THE ASTONISHED COMPTON HOW TO BEHAVE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” observed John Compton as,
holding Bobby’s hand, he sauntered
along that Bagdad of a street, Hollywood
Boulevard, “you’ve scored the first time at
the bat, Bobby. You’re under a contract at
thirty-five dollars a week, and a bonus of two
hundred dollars if you make good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like to make money,” cried Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do? Have you made much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I never made a cent in my life; but I
like to, just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you fond of money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby did not make an immediate reply. He
was trying, not unsuccessfully, to “take off”
the mincing gait of a young lady in front of
him, who, considering the tightness of her skirt
and the height of her truncated cone heels, was
doing very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I don’t care for money; but mother
needs it. Say, this is a nice place. I like flowers,
lots of them, and nice white houses and
palm trees and bright sunshine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All these things,” observed John Compton
“are our long suit in Hollywood. If there ever
was a paradise on earth, it must have been
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all you know?” inquired the lad, his
lip curling in scorn. “Why, of course there
was a paradise! Didn’t you ever study catechism?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—er, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Bobby, relaxing
from scorn to benevolence, “I’ll teach you
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word!” ejaculated Compton,
and fell into meditation, from which he was
presently aroused by the strange behavior of
the people on the street. Were they staring
and laughing at him? Turning, he discovered
Bobby, a little to the rear of him, doing the
Bowery walk and wearing a face becoming a
hardened pickpocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here, you young imp! You’re giving
our show away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I never thought of that!” cried Bobby,
putting on the air of a Sunday-school superintendent.
“I just can’t help it,” he went on.
“I just love to act.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, have you ever acted before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but I just love to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see a church more charmingly
situated?” asked the comedian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were passing the Church of the Blessed
Sacrament, a church hardly to be seen from the
sidewalk. It stood well back from the street,
hidden by large palms, pepper trees, and a
profusion of flowers and foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a Catholic church?” the boy inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go in and pay a visit,” suggested the
lad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t go to church,” returned Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Bobby’s lip curled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must be crazy,” he said. “Now, you
come on in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, it was clear, was in no mood for
argument. Catching Compton by the hand, he
led that astonished young man along the lovely
path towards the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that sign about up there?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It says,” answered Compton, “that it was
here or in the immediate vicinity that Father
Junipero Serra said the Mass of the Holy
Cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard of him and read a book about
him,” said Bobby. “He must have been a
great man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” interrogated the skeptic. “I’ve
heard it said that the Mass of the Holy Cross is
the same as the Mass of the Holy Wood; and
that’s the reason we call this section Hollywood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that name now more than ever,
uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On entering the vestibule Bobby hunted for
and quickly found the holy-water font. Dipping
his finger in, he devoutly made the sign
of the cross, while Mr. Compton gazed at him
as though he were seeing for the first time an
unusually occult rite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby motioned him; then pointed to the
font. Compton came forward obediently
enough, but he would not or could not understand
what the child further expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here!” whispered Bobby, with unsmiling
face. And catching Mr. Compton’s reluctant
right hand, he dipped its index finger in the
font.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now say what I say,” he adjured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on tiptoe, Bobby placed the captive
finger on Compton’s forehead, brought it
down to the breast, then to the left and the
right shoulder, while Compton, his face red as
a Los Angeles geranium, repeated after his
young mentor, “In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do it better next time,” remarked
Bobby consolingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now come on!” And Bobby, pushing the
comedian in front of him, proceeded fully half
way up the center aisle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you genuflect,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” said Compton, looking like the “nut”
he played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sh-h-h!” warned Bobby. “Look.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Bobby bent his right knee, holding himself
quite erect, till it touched the floor. “Now
do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton made the effort; and Compton,
who could turn handsprings and bend the crab
and stop a grounder and catch a fly with a
grace that had won the hearts of the fair sex
in many a city, bent his knee with the effect of
one suffering from locomotor ataxia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Bobby’s lip curled. He was
minded to make Mr. Compton do it again, but
on second thought changed his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in that pew,” he whispered, in manifest
disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing for Compton to do but
obey. Bobby followed after him and, a second
time signing himself with the sign of the cross,
knelt down. Compton, looking, as he felt, inexpressibly
stupid, seated himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby stared at him severely, arose, and
catching his friend by the arm coaxed him to
his knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Bobby made an elaborate sign
of the cross, during the performance of which
the comedian, leaning back, braced himself
comfortably against the end of the seat. It
came home to Bobby by this time that he was
“instructing the ignorant.” He must do it in
all kindness. After all, it might not be Compton’s
fault. So, smiling sweetly but with the
severe restraint proper to a church where the
Lord of all was present in the tabernacle, he
reached forward a tiny hand, applied it to the
small of Compton’s back, and pressed forward
till Compton was kneeling erect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the proper way to kneel,” he whispered
kindly. “Now just keep that way, and
say your prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sound so like a giggle that it
really could not have been anything else proceeding
from the back of the church, and three
young ladies, their handkerchiefs at their
mouths, incontinently left the church. Several
other worshipers left, clearly for the same
reason. Only one worshiper remained, a man
whose romances had thrilled hundreds of thousands
of readers. Restraining his features, he
tiptoed up the aisle, and knelt at an angle
where he could see Bobby’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In no wise realizing that he had emptied the
church, Bobby for the third time crossed himself
and, undisturbed by Compton, began to
pray. It had been for Compton a day of many
surprises. But now it was a moment of astonishment.
Glancing sidewise, he took in Bobby’s
face. Just a few minutes before, he had reprehended
Bobby for wearing the air of a criminal;
and now—-he was looking upon the face of an
angel! And there was a difference, too, of
another kind, as Compton at once realized.
Looking like a criminal, Bobby was acting;
looking like an angel Bobby was himself, his
natural self touched by faith into something
strange and rare. The boy’s eyes, large,
earnest, beseeching, were fastened upon the
tabernacle; his lips were moving in a silent
eloquence. His head, erect, was motionless.
So, for that matter, was his whole person—all
save those eloquent lips. At that moment, as
Compton felt, there existed for Bobby only
two persons, God and himself. For the first
time in his life Compton was seized with a
sense of the supernatural. He bowed his head
upon his hands and looked no more. It was
the most sacred moment of his life. If Compton
did not pray orally, he did something
better. He meditated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eminent author saw the vision, too. He
had stayed for curiosity’s sake; he remained to
pray. Like Compton, the vision of lovely faith—and
what is there out of heaven so lovely as
the faith of a child?—quite overcame him. He
gazed no more, but, lowering his eyes, prayed
with a new devotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw a little boy praying in church,” he
said to his wife an hour later, “and I understood
as I never understood before that saying
of our Lord’s, ‘Unless you become as little
children you shall not enter the kingdom of
heaven.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several minutes passed. A light touch
brought Compton out of a virgin land of
thought. Bobby, tranquil and with a subdued
cheerfulness, was motioning him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Watch!” whispered Bobby, and genuflected.
“Now try it again. Fine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the vestibule five minutes were spent, by
which time Compton really knew how to make
the sign of the cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby,” he said, as they got outside,
“that’s my first visit to a Catholic church, and
I’ll never forget it as long as I live.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE END OF A DAY OF SURPRISES</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here we are, young man,” announced
Compton half an hour later
and turned into a rather pretentious apartment
building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks very fine from the outside,” commented
Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think you’ll like it inside, too,” returned
Compton as they entered the elevator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton had an apartment on the third
floor—sitting room, bathroom, bedroom and
guest chamber. Bobby examined the suite
with manifest delight. Everything was modern
and in a sense elegant. If there were anything
lacking to John Compton’s comfort, John
Compton did not know it, nor did Bobby discover
it. Bobby’s critical faculty was not as
yet strongly developed. He had nevertheless
an abundance of enthusiasm which he was not
slow in expressing, and which failed him only
in his survey of the pictures and photographs
clustered thickly upon the walls of the sitting
room. They were, with the exception of
several photographs of Compton himself, all
women, mainly actresses and all in every
variety of dress and the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, are all your friends women?” exclaimed
the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton colored and looked uneasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You’re</span> my friend,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s something queer about a lot of
these pictures,” the boy went on. “I don’t
like them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton changed the subject. Within
twenty-four hours, nevertheless, a good many
of those pictures found their way to a place
where they properly belonged, and were seen
no more in the land of sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Bobby,” he resumed presently,
“You haven’t said a word about your mother
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Bobby cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I have bad news to tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll bet you haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That telegram I sent may not be received
by her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It was delayed. A lot of messages
were delayed. You know, it was to have been
delivered to her at the station at San Luis
Obispo. But there’s no knowing whether it
will be forwarded in time to catch her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, uncle; I’ll tell you a secret. I
have prayed, and I’m sure—I just know—my
prayer is all right. No harm will come to my
mother. She is safe; and she will come back
when God wants her to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be on intimate terms with the
Almighty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?” inquired Bobby simply.
“Don’t you believe in prayer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word!” gasped the comedian.
“I could have answered that question easily
enough yesterday; but now I don’t know what
I believe and what I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What gem of wisdom might have dropped
from Bobby’s lips in commenting upon this
strange declaration was lost forever when the
janitor of the building suddenly entered the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beg pardon, sir. I wasn’t sure you were
here. But I think there’s some mistake.
There’s a wagon down below with some furniture
and a lot of stuff directed to you, and you—not
being a family man—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Correct, Johnson. All the same, send them
up. There’s no mistake. You see, this boy is
Bobby Compton, and he’s going to stay with
me. He’s a cousin of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say!” cried Bobby. “If I’m your
aunt or your nephew, I want to know how I’m
your cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Johnson,” said Compton magnificently,
“when I say cousin I always mean nephew.
It’s the habit of a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” observed Johnson, scratching his
head. “Well, I’ll bring them things up
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” sighed Compton, throwing himself
back in his chair, crossing his legs, and cupping
his hands behind his head, “I’m glad that’s
settled. I was afraid they wouldn’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby took the chair facing his uncle,
crossed his legs, and cupped his hands behind
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Afraid what wouldn’t come, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never you mind, little monkey. Just wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s patience was not sorely tried. Up
the stairs toiled four men just then, Johnson in
the lead, all laden with bundles and various
articles of furniture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way, boys,” said Compton, opening
the door to the guestroom. “Just wait one
moment, Bobby.” And Compton, having seen
to each one’s getting through, entered himself
and closed the door. He was out a moment
later, holding in his hand an attractively bound
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever read ‘Through the Desert,’
by Sienkiewicz, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I just love any good story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, take it. I’ll be busy for a while. The
book is yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine for good?” cried Bobby, raising his
eyes from the charming frontispiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle, you’re a dandy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dandy blushingly withdrew, and Bobby
forthwith entered into that fairyland of childhood
to be found in few books as in the one in
his hand. Perhaps one of the strangest
phenomena of child life is the power of complete
absorption so many little ones possess
when they read a good story. People may
come and go, laugh, talk and carry on in
various ways, while the child buried in his book
follows the windings of the story as though he
were alone on a desert island. Now for fully
three quarters of an hour there went on in the
guestroom a moving of furniture, loud hammering,
excited conversation, and all manner
of noises. But to Bobby’s ears came no sound,
and time itself stood still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the four men, followed by Mr.
Compton, the latter breathing hard and perspiring
freely, issued forth, Bobby, seated in
a chair with his legs curled under him, was
buried in the precious volume. The four men
gratefully received various coins and went their
way, leaving Mr. Compton gazing wonderingly
at the juvenile bookworm. So far as
Bobby was concerned, he might without interruption
have gone on gazing indefinitely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby!” he finally called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s eyes remained fastened on the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby!” he bawled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy raised his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s great!” he said. “I’ve read fifty-four
pages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have read enough. Come, I want to
show you your room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, uncle,” returned the boy, wistfully
laying down the story. “You’ve stopped
me in a most exciting part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing open the guestroom door, Compton
said, “Walk in; it’s all yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an attempt at enthusiasm, Bobby complied.
In a moment the forced enthusiasm
became genuine. A small shining brass bed, a
snow-white counterpane, a case of books filled
with the best juveniles, an electric railroad, a
baseball equipment, a tiny rocker, an easy
chair, and a variety of games—all these and
more charmed his eyes into a new brightness
and marshaled out upon his features a myriad
elves of happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Mr. Compton could prepare for the
worst Bobby jumped into his arms and caught
him a kiss square upon his unprepared mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two hours Bobby flitted from toy to
game, from game to book. He was possibly at
that moment the happiest boy in the State of
California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, look you, Bobby, it’s ten o’clock.
Don’t you think you might give that bed a
tryout?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I never thought of that! Gee, but
I’m tired!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton thought, as he closed the door
upon his ward, that his dealings with the boy
were over till morning. He was mistaken.
Presently, clad in rainbow pajamas, Bobby
came forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’m ready,” he declared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you’re ready, why don’t you go to
bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready,” explained the child, with reproach
in his eyes, “for my night prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed the comedian. “I never
thought of that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lad’s curling lip warned Mr. Compton
that his remark was not particularly happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course!” he added hastily.
“How very absent-minded I am getting! By
all means, Bobby, go on and say your prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Compton thus spoke he was lying
restfully on a lounge, a cigar in his mouth, a
newspaper in his hands, and, within easy reach,
a glass filled almost to the brim with a golden
liquid. What was his surprise, thus situated,
when Bobby plumped down on his knees and,
planting his elbows in the softest part of the
comedian’s anatomy, made the sign of the cross
and recited the Our Father, the Hail Mary,
and the Acts. And he did not stop there.
Raising his sweet voice a little higher, and
glancing during the first line about the walls
of the room, Bobby recited:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>Angel of God, my guardian dear,</span></p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>Ever this night he at my side,</span></p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;<span class='it'>To light, to guard, to rule, to guide.</span>”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton, whose cigar had gone out,
laid aside his paper, and forgetting his drink,
glanced behind him, almost expecting to see
hovering over him some bright and glorious
creature of another world. Bobby went on:
“May the soul of my dear papa and all the
souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.
Amen. God bless mamma—and God bless—uncle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton dropped his cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” continued Bobby, raising beautiful
and loving eyes to the ceiling, “Oh, blessed
Saviour bring back my mamma to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Bobby broke down utterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, Bobby! You know what you told
me. Didn’t you say God will bring her back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby at these words mastered his tears,
made the sign of the cross, and answered as he
rose: “And I say so still. Good-night, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby leaned over with pursed lips. Compton
was perspiring. He raised his head, which
was enough for Bobby, who gave him a hearty
smack resembling in sound the explosion of a
mild firecracker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About eleven o’clock that night Compton
tiptoed into the guestroom. The moon’s silvery
rays revealed clearly the sleeping lad. How
sweet and calm looked the innocent face in the
magic light!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there an angel watching over him?” the
man asked himself. Twenty-four hours earlier
he would have considered it a silly question,
but now—</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stooped lower and gazed more intently
upon the child’s face. Was that a tear upon
the cheek? He felt the pillow. It was wet in
places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a brave little chap he is!” he commented.
“He’s feeling his separation from his
mother dreadfully. But he keeps it to himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Compton gazed. And then for
a moment he saw another face—sweet, noble—the
face of Bobby’s mother as he had known
her in her early teens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” he considered, “she was the sweetest
woman that ever came into my life! What a
fool I was not to have taken her advice! I left
her for the husks of swine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton bent down, and with trembling lips
touched the boy, lightly, reverently on the
brow, and with a suppressed sigh turned away
to give to sleep the last hour of the most remarkable
day of his life.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BOBBY MEETS AN ENEMY ON THE BOULEVARD AND A FRIEND IN THE LANTRY STUDIO</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a little after eight of the clock on the
following morning that the comedian took
his way along the boulevard towards the
Lantry studio. Bobby’s eyes were dancing
with mischief; the soul of the weather, gay
and bland, had entered into him. As he went
his way he dispensed lavish smiles to right
and left, and poor indeed was he in human
feeling who failed to return smile for smile.
Many a passer-by craned his neck, having
passed Bobby, to take an admiring look at
the tiny dispenser of joy who, attired in black
broadcloth knickerbockers, a vest of the same
material cut away generously from the breast
and decked with two shining buttons where it
met at the waist, a white shirt foaming into
frills, the sleeves of which were held up above
the wrists by two bewitching white ribbons,
was really rather like to a lily of the field than
Solomon clothed in all his glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course Hollywood, like all known civilized
places where men do congregate, had its
array of camera fiends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” said one of these, a
tall severe-looking man with dark glasses,
“but would you mind my snap-shotting you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby turned, folded his hands, and grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said the man, his severe mien
drowned in a wave of smiles almost as gay as
Bobby’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have all heard of St. Francis preaching a
sermon simply by walking in silence through
a thronged city. Does not many an innocent
child as he goes his happy way, smiling and
wondering, preach a sermon that has for its
theme the charm of candid innocence, and the
strange and alluring possibility of every one
who is so minded to become, by taking himself
in hand, a child again? And is it not true that
such little children bring a man’s thoughts regretfully
and humbly back to the days when he
too was young, unsophisticated and unspoiled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re getting quite popular, Bobby,”
observed Compton as they resumed their way.
“Everybody seems to like you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” returned Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like everybody, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of the mouths of children,” Mr.
Compton murmured to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t quite hear you, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was saying,” translated the elder, “that
whether you knew it or not you have given the
true secret of popularity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have we time to go in?” asked Bobby as
they neared the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, and I’ll be glad to go in with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton’s sign of the cross was beyond
criticism, his genuflection not so bad; also, he
knelt straight, and, in a word, showed the outward
signs of intelligence so lacking on the
occasion of his first visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, uncle,” Bobby remarked as they
came out, “you’ve improved a lot. You didn’t
look around a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People often do, you know, when they’re
praying; but it’s not right. Did you notice me
looking around at the walls when I said the
prayer ‘Angel of God’ last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you come to speak of it, I believe
I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed Compton, in a tone at
once exclamatory and interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. At home when I came to that prayer
I always looked at the picture of the guardian
angel which hung just above mamma’s head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you looked around my walls among
the pictures to see whether you could find a
picture of the guardian angel, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, uncle; but I didn’t find a picture anything
like one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not!” said Compton with
energy. “But, Bobby, I was glad last night
when you prayed for me. I hope you’ll keep it
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha!” cried Bobby dramatically, jumping
in front of his uncle and shaking a triumphant
finger at him. “So you do believe in prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In your prayers, Bobby. Put that finger
down and stop your jigging; everybody is
looking at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, Bobby had achieved a
feat seldom achieved on the Hollywood Boulevard.
He had, unintentionally of course,
excited the attention of nearly every one he had
encountered. Now on the gay and festive
Hollywood Boulevard, be it known, all varieties
of dress and action are to be seen, and
nobody seems to bother about them. In the
solemn watches of the night cavalcades of cowboys
on horseback may come clattering along,
shooting in the real sense of the word, and
shouting. Possibly some light sleeper may
rouse sufficiently to grasp the situation. Turning
in his bed, he remarks: “There go them
moving-picture fellers again,” and resumes
his interrupted slumbers. There’s an old man,
white-bearded, redfaced from exposure, bare-footed,
clad in a modern substitute for the
garments of St. John, and wearing a staff. He
is frequently seen on the street, but nobody
seems to be concerned so much as to take a
second look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I forgot to say that this imitation St. John
the Baptist goes bareheaded. Practically all
the men on the boulevard go bareheaded. I
myself, I dare say, could patrol that famous
thoroughfare in cassock and biretta without
exciting any further comment than, “I wonder
what picture that fellow’s made up for.”
Painted ladies—painted so profusely that their
own mothers would not know them—would
there escape comment or criticism. It would
be taken for granted that they were actresses.
The camera would mitigate their extravagance,
and their presentment on the screen would be
entirely lacking the grossness of their real
flesh-and-blood appearances. But Bobby, gay
and smiling, taking off now the stride of his
uncle, now the gait of a passing flapper, woke
the street from its passive acquiescence in all
things queer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It remained for Bobby to create a sensation.
He did so, and in the following way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton, excusing himself and inviting
the festive youth to survey the scenery and fill
his soul with its beauty, had passed into a shop
to renew his supply of cigars. He delayed a
few moments, very excusably, to tell a friend
what a wonderful find his nephew was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, since their leaving the Hollywood
Catholic church, there had been shadowing
Bobby, Chucky Snuff, bellhop of yesterday’s
play. It had never occurred to Chucky that
Bobby’s attempt to help him had been made in
the way of kindness. Quite otherwise. In justice
to the younger set of moving-picture
actors, it should be stated that Chucky Snuff
was not up to form. He was, as the girls said,
mean. Nobody liked him. A fond father and
a foolish mother had accounted him, in his
tender years, a swan; and they so petted and
spoiled him as to develop him—allowing for
difference of sex—into a goose. At the age of
ten Chucky was stunted and blasé.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking advantage of Compton’s disappearance,
Chucky picked up a piece of wood
and hastened to overtake Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, halloa!” said Bobby as Chucky, running
in front of him, blocked the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By way of return the other put on a face
which, had he assumed it in the rehearsal,
might have saved him his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” he said, placing the wood on his
right shoulder, “you knock that chip off my
shoulder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s smile left him, and all the elves of
merriment. Perplexity wrinkled his brow.
The aggressor was much encouraged. Bobby,
he judged, was a coward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” he urged. “I’m going to knock
your block off, you big stiff. Do you hear
me? Go on and knock it off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby perceived that he was in for it. His
mind, as usual, worked quickly. It came back
to him then how his father had once said, “My
son, never indulge in vulgar fist-fighting if you
can possibly help yourself; but if you must,
it’s a capital thing to get in the first blow.”
Accordingly, no sooner had his opponent
ceased his adjuration than Bobby’s left hand
lightly swept the chip away, while at the same
moment his right shot out with what force he
could put into it, and landed squarely on the
tip of the other’s chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pain, astonishment, vast astonishment,
swept over the face of Chucky Snuff.
He turned, and with a howl which really
attracted attention dashed away for parts unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine work! Excellent!” exclaimed a
haughty young man with a close-trimmed mustache
and severely aristocratic features as he
caught Bobby’s hand, while an admiring audience
gathered round to listen avidly to one of
the matinee idols of filmdom. “That was
splendidly done. That other fellow played the
tough to a nicety. The way he had his chin
stuck out and the way you landed on it was
perfect. Say, it was perfectly rehearsed!
You can shoot it right away. Where’s the
camera man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that wasn’t acting,” Bobby explained.
“That was a real scrap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said the actor, deeply chagrined and
departing forthwith; and the disappointed
spectators, realizing that there was to be no
encore, melted away. Thus in Hollywood are
real life and reel life confounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When John Compton, airily smoking, returned,
Bobby was rubbing a skinned knuckle,
the cause of which, on inquiry, he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My fault!” acknowledged the comedian.
“You’re in my care and I should not leave you
alone. However, perhaps it’s just as well. I
know young Chucky Snuff pretty well, and
I’m sure he’ll not bother you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently Bobby, on his way in the mazes
of the Lantry Studio to put himself into the
bellhop’s clothes, came upon a little miss seated
dolefully in a chair, her head buried in her
hands, her shoulders bowed, and dejection in
her entire pose. She was dressed like a princess.
The elegance of her attire, however, did
not impress Bobby; it was her hair, raven-black
in a wealth of curls. Where had he seen
that hair before? He looked at the hands.
They were dark. A light came to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halloa, Peggy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the words the girl raised her head, and
her large wondrously beautiful eyes rested
upon Bobby. With a gasp, she sprang from
her chair, while her eyes grew larger and
larger. Fear and wonder shone from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know me, Peggy?” asked the
boy, smiling radiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wonder and fear in those eyes changed to a
joy that was nothing less than bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bobby! You’re alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby!” she screamed, and threw her arms
about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say!” protested the highly embarrassed
youth, “cut out the rough stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Bobby,” continued Peggy, whose face
was irradiated with joy, “I saw you drown
myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did not. A nice, big man came and
fished me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank God! Last night I couldn’t
sleep a wink thinking of you and your poor
mother. Where is she, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew, Peggy. Didn’t you see her
last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Peggy told Bobby her side of the
story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so my mother thinks I’m drowned!
I never thought of that, Peggy. But I’ll tell
Uncle Compton, and he’ll find where she is and
let her know that I’m alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Compton! Why, is he your uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know; it all depends. First I was
his aunt, and then his uncle, and then his grandfather.
He said so himself. Anyhow, I call
him uncle. He’s a dandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he, though!” exclaimed Peggy. “I
just love him. He’s so kind to children. You
know, Bobby, I work with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” cried Bobby, picking up the chair
which Peggy in rising had upset, and seating
himself. “Why, yesterday you never said a
word to me about your being in the movies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t think it would interest you. I’m
in his new play, and there’s an awfully tough
bellhop in it who takes a fancy to me, and
I reform him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby took in a deep breath, and expelled it
in a sort of whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m the bellhop,” he said, lowering his eyes,
turning down a corner of his mouth, drawing
in and upward his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby!” panted Peggy, “let me have that
chair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, changing back to himself, arose and
helped Peggy to seat herself. Peggy was faint
with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” cried the boy, “we’ll have dead loads
of fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’ll make it go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Peggy. “Just then you
looked like the kind of bellhop I’d like to reform.
But tell me how you got here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Between the ax, Peggy,” said Bobby, magnificently,
after the manner of Compton explaining
to the janitor. “I’ll tell you between
the ax. I’ll tell you then. I’m now going to
dress or I’ll be late.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SHOWING THAT IMITATION IS NOT ALWAYS THE SINCEREST FLATTERY, AND RETURNING TO THE MISADVENTURES OF BOBBY’S MOTHER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There was great headway made on the
picture that day. Bernadette, already
in love with Peggy, took Bobby into her affections
too. Bobby and Peggy worked together
like the clever and gifted pals they
actually were. Even the “hams” caught the
infection of joy, alertness and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, old man,” said Heneman, in an aside
to Compton, “we’ve got something unusual
here. Every man, woman and child in this
picture is all right from the toes up to the
top of the head. None of them are good just
as far as the neck. We’re going to speed this
thing up and have it out in two weeks. We
can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw Peggy do so well before, and
she always was a corking little actress,” commented
Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Bobby,” explained the director. “He’s
got a diffusive sort of pep; it’s catching. I’ve
got a great scene coming. When Bob gets
to admiring Peggy—in the play, I mean—I’m
going to have him show his admiration by
imitation. The boy is a born imitator. Of
course he’ll have to caricature it, especially her
dancing. It’s going to be the very best sort
of light comedy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If imitation,” mused Compton, “is the beginning,
middle and end of all acting, Bobby
will be a star. Between times he’s taking off
every carpenter, electrician or camera man
around who happens to have any peculiarity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to see him have a part where he
could star,” said Heneman. “It isn’t work to
train him. It’s fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days passed swiftly. Everybody concerned
in the production was on edge to get
it through. There were no hitches, no delays.
Bobby and Peggy worked their parts
into an importance undreamed of by the author
of the scenario. There was but one unpleasant
episode. It happened on the eighth
day. A girl of fifteen enjoying a local reputation
for calisthenics had been secured to give a
short exhibition of her grace and skill. The
young miss more than shared the good opinion
of her admirers concerning her own ability,
and made no secret of it. While awaiting
her turn she watched the performers at work,
with scarcely veiled contempt. Several of the
actors gave her an opportunity to snub them,
and in every case she embraced the opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say,” she observed to
Peggy, “that they pay you for what you’re doing
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They pay me every week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what you call easy money, isn’t it?
And I suppose that little boy there gets paid,
too. And all he does is just to be natural.
Now, I’ve studied Delsarte for over five years,
and fancy dancing for three; and when I appear,
though it’s only for four or five minutes,
I’m putting into my work the study of a lifetime.”
Saying which, the young lady with elevated
brows and haughty carriage turned away
to seek some other person who ought to be
snubbed. When it came to elevating brows
and assuming a haughty carriage Bobby Vernon
was unusually gifted, as he forthwith demonstrated
to Peggy in a splendid caricature of
the follower of Delsarte. The girl’s mother
was on hand and observed Bobby’s private performance
with strong disfavor. She did not
like Bobby anyhow. It had become a personal
matter with her that Bobby was drawing a
higher salary than her own accomplished and
superior child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the dear child performed her
stunt. It was really good, good despite a certain
superciliousness in the doing. Now
Bobby could not help noticing this defect, and
it was so easily imitated. He watched carefully
for some time until he had got a fair
idea of a few of the young miss’s simplest
movements; then calling Peggy aside he gave,
all things considered, a very good Delsarte exhibition,
with a strong injection of the supercilious.
Peggy’s sweet voice rang out in laughter
which attracted several to the side-show;
and Bobby, unconscious of the addition to his
original audience of one, went on, gaining in
force of caricature with each movement. It
was when his nose was tiptilted to an unusual
angle and his eyebrows raised as far as he
could get them that the fond mother caught
him by the hair and gave him, as she afterwards
triumphantly declared, “a good wooling.” It
took the major part of the spectators to separate
the woman from her victim. However,
Bobby got a good lesson. It dawned upon
him that in “taking off” people he met he
might give offense. From that day he became
a little more careful. Mr. Compton too, his
best friend, let him know that it served him
right, although he did not express the opinion
in terms so crude. Bobby apologized, and
sealed the apology with a box of candy. The
young miss, seeing herself as others saw her,
received in turn a valuable lesson, with the result
that on repeating her part she did it in
a way that pleased everybody present, including
Bobby himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meditating on all this that afternoon, John
Compton got a bright idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby,” he said, as they turned homewards,
“for the next seven days I want you to give
your evenings to reading while I work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I’ve just got the idea for a scenario
in which you will star. It’s a sure thing. As
I see it now it will be something new and, if
it goes through as I think, you’ll earn enough
money to pay off everything your mother
owes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great!” exclaimed the boy. “Say; you
know of course I believe all right. But don’t
you think God is taking His time about answering
my prayers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you said that you left it all to
Him,” remonstrated Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, I do. But I do so miss her, especially
at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one knew this better than John Compton.
When the boy’s thoughts were occupied
by the day’s work and incidents, he was apparently
care-free; but at night alone, as
Compton could testify, his tears were frequent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, Bobby. I’m as sure as you
that no real harm has befallen your mother.
And we’re bound to find her. The detective
agency I have put on the case is working
hard. Be patient, my boy, and each day of
her absence think that you are working for
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the two were thus conversing the object
of their talk was standing beside the ranchman’s
wife. Like her child, love was the great
force of Mrs. Vernon’s life. From the moment
she entered the ranchman’s home, her
heart went out to the frail, sweet woman upon
whom the hand of death seemed to have set
his seal. She saw at once that nothing but
heroic, constant care and watching would avail.
Day after day she gave herself devotedly to
the task of fighting with death for the prize
of a single life. She hardly slept, she ate little,
but the very power of love that had nearly
driven her to madness nerved her for an ordeal
sublime in its self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those eight days a change had come over
Barbara. She was thin, hollow-eyed, and a
waxen pallor had come upon her face. The
light lines of utmost weariness were stamped
upon her features. But the chin was set, the
mouth firm. The only relief to her constant
vigils were the visits of the children. They
were grateful beyond their years, and their
gratitude manifested itself in little hourly attentions
which only love could have devised. It
was but natural that Barbara should return
their affection, and she did so with interest.
And in loving them she felt that she was vicariously
spending her love upon her dear lost
boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon this particular afternoon her haggard
face, lovely even in its haggardness, was
touched by a new expression—satisfaction.
Clearly her invalid was better. Even as she
gazed the doctor entered the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good day, Doctor Meehan,” she said, “I’m
so glad you came. Don’t you notice a change?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me look,” responded the doctor, drawing
close and peering into the invalid’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halloa!” he exclaimed, and felt her pulse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jim Regan, the ranchman, with his two children,
Agnes and Louis, had followed him into
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George, Regan!” said the doctor,
straightening up and turning with a smile of
relief upon the family, “this is no age of miracles.
But we have a near-miracle here. Your
wife is no longer ill; she’s convalescent. All
she needs is rest and food and ordinary care.
Barbara Vernon has, with her own hands,
dragged her back from the grave. Halloa!
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Mrs. Vernon who had drawn this
question from the doctor. On hearing the glad
news that brought tears and smiles of joy
from the family, Barbara’s face flushed with
a sense of relief, went pale again, and, the suspense
over, she would have fallen had not the
doctor caught her in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He placed her upon a lounge and made a
hasty examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope this is not a life for a life,” he said
presently. “But the sick person of this house
is not your wife, but Barbara Vernon. She’s
in for a long siege, I fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor,” said the ranchman, “if love or
money can help her, I’ll not fail. Tell me what
to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like that sort of talk,” said the physician.
“She needs a nurse badly, as badly as
your wife needed one. Now, fortunately I
have at my disposal the very nurse I would
have had for your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you send her, doctor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll have her here before nightfall, and she’ll
bring the necessary medicines and directions as
to the line of treatment I want carried out
for Barbara, who has collapsed completely.
Now mind, it isn’t altogether her care of your
wife that has brought this on. If Barbara
Vernon has not had some terrible nervous
shock before you met her, you may tear up my
diploma and put me to carrying a hod. Barbara
is threatened with a serious nervous collapse.
Put her to bed at once, and keep her
there till further orders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about my wife?” asked Regan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The simplest thing in the world. She
hardly needs watching at all, and that jewel
of a girl of yours, Agnes, can do all that’s
needed to the queen’s taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I love to nurse,” said the girl. “I’ve
watched dear Miss Barbara, and I’ve learned
so much. I know I can do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you, my girl,” said the doctor
kindly. “In fact, I’m sure of you. Now your
father and I will carry Barbara to her bedroom,
and you will then care for her till our
nurse comes. I’ll lose no time in getting her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Barbara was put to bed, and many and
many a week passed before she rose from it
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, uncle,” said Bobby one afternoon
as the two were returning from a very
successful day’s work at the Lantry Studio,
“do you know that Peggy Sansone goes to
communion every morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she does, does she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, at the seven-o’clock Mass. She used
to go only once a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why has she changed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what gets me, uncle. She’s going
every day in thanksgiving because I was not
drowned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very nice of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it? And she offers up each communion
for my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish there were more Peggies in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I. Now look, uncle—I want to go
to communion, too. I’m old enough to make
my first communion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Bobby! You just go on and make
it. Do you want to do it now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, uncle; I’m—I’m surprised at
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what have I done now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know a boy must be prepared,
and go to confession and get permission of the
priest to go to communion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And you can’t go any time. Why,
uncle, if I were to go into the church now
and ask for communion the priest would
think I was a nut. No, you must go at Mass
in the morning, and be fasting from midnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by communion,
Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know that? It means the receiving
of Our Lord’s body and blood under the
form and appearance of bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I remember,” said Compton. “One
day on our way down to the studio, when we
went into the church for your visit, the priest
came down from the altar and put small, white,
round things on the tongues of some people
who came up near the altar. Is that what you
mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t. He comes down and gives
them Our Lord, and those small, white, round
things are the form and appearance of bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you really believe that, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe it!” cried Bobby. “Why, of course
I do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please tell me why. You see, Bobby, if an
honest man tells me something about what I
don’t see—for instance, that his horse is black—I
believe him. But no matter how honest
he is, if he tells me the horse he is riding on
is black and I see the horse is white, how can I
accept his statement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, that’s easy,” said Bobby. “Not exactly
easy,” he hastened to add, “till it’s been
explained right. You see, before I left Cincinnati
I was in a communion class, and we had
the nicest priest, who seemed to love every
child in the class, and there were eighty of us,
not one over eight years. We left Cincinnati
just one week before our communion day, and
that is why I haven’t made it. But he taught
us a lot, and that is one of the things he taught
us. Do you want me to explain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly do, Bobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, listen. You believe in God, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton looked irresolute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose that I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Now God is the creator of all
things. He can make things out of nothing.
Can’t He?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on, Bobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, if He can create out of nothing, He
can make a thing nothing again if He wants
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is,” suggested Compton, “He can annihilate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” cried Bobby, highly gratified, “where
did you get that word? It’s the one our priest
used, but I couldn’t think of it. It’s easy to
teach you. Now look—stand still here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton stood still, facing Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re here now, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s certain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t God, if He wanted, annihilate you
just where you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s suppose He could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there wouldn’t be any John Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if God could annihilate you, couldn’t
He leave here where you stand a form and
appearance that would look just exactly like
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be a dummy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, you hold on, uncle! Couldn’t God
put inside that form and appearance of yours
a spirit—an angel maybe—so that your form
and appearance, under the power of that angel,
would talk and act exactly like you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think an angel would talk and act
like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, you’re getting the idea. It isn’t a
question whether an angel would talk and act
like you; the question is, could an angel do
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Bobby triumphantly, poking
his uncle in the ribs, “suppose that God just
now annihilated you and put an angel in your
place, how could I know it wasn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you just couldn’t know. You would
think it was me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think again, uncle; it’s a hard question.
It stumped the whole of our communion class
for five minutes, and I got the right answer,
and the priest gave me a holy picture for answering
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton wrinkled his brows in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s one thing sure,” he at length said,
“God would know that the thing in my place
was not John Compton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle, you’re getting hot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And therefore,” pursued Compton, speaking
slowly, “if God told you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurrah!” cried Bobby, clicking his heels together
as he jumped into the air. “You go to
the head of the class. I’d know it if God told
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But would you believe it?” objected the
elder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s lip curled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, uncle, didn’t we agree that God could
do it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shouldn’t we believe Him, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’re right. But what’s that got
to do with Holy Communion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen. At the Last Supper, Christ, who
was God, took bread, and blessed it, and said:
‘Take ye and eat; this is my body.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember hearing that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And didn’t the Apostles believe Him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose they did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet what Christ held in His hands
looked like bread, tasted and felt and smelt
like bread. Was it bread?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I guess it was bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, look here, uncle—who am I to believe,
you or Christ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that—Oh, why Christ of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you say it’s bread, and a whole lot
of people say the same thing. But Christ says
it is His body, and His word is worth more
than the word of all the duffers in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s walk on,” said Compton, and fell into
thought. “Bobby, why do you want to make
your first communion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I want to pray for my mother and—and
for you, and to get grace and strength.
You know, uncle, it’s the greatest thing in the
world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose we go in and see a priest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle!” exclaimed Bobby, “you’re all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Father Mallory, a zealous, kindly young
priest, received Bobby with a rare cordiality,
and while Compton sat by in respectful attention,
questioned the boy at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Compton,” said Father Mallory, before
ten minutes had quite elapsed, “this boy
is as well prepared as any child I ever met.
He has brains and, what is immeasurably better,
faith. Bobby, you may go to confession,
say, three days from now, and then to communion
the next day, Saturday morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Father,” said Bobby, “thank you!
And may I use that telephone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Peggy?—Yes, this is Bobby.
Say, I’ve got great news.—No, no news of my
mother, but I know she’s all right.—Guess
again.—No.—You’re getting cold.—Now
you’re getting warmer. Oh, say; I’ll bust if
I keep it in any longer. I’m going to make my
first communion next Saturday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two in waiting heard clearly a scream
of delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it great?” pursued the boy. “And if
Father Mallory, who is a jim-dandy, will let
me, I’m going to go every day. Yes, I thought
you’d be glad to know. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talking to Peggy,” explained Bobby
as he hung up the receiver. “She’s mighty
glad, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next three days were crowded ones.
Bobby, who had heard of retreats before first
communion, decided that he would try, so far
as he could, to make one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle,” he said the next morning, “I’ve
been thinking last night, and I’m going to keep
silence for three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” cried Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; I’m going to make a retreat before
my first communion—that is, as much as I can.
Of course I’ll work just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In like manner he conveyed his intentions
to Peggy, who thought it a capital idea. And
during these three days the company derived
no end of innocent merriment from the pantomime
performances of Peggy and the boy, who
really kept silence, but who nevertheless
showed an extraordinary ability in conveying
his emotions by gestures and motions and facial
expression. On the whole, Peggy and Bobby
during these three days had the time of their
lives. It must be stated that Bobby more than
once fell from grace, and made an attempt
at starting a conversation. But Peggy, older
by two years, was resolute. Up went her finger
to the mouth, while reproach, gentle but
sincere, shone from her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once did Peggy fail in her duty as
directress of this unusual retreat. On the third
day Bobby handed her a note.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Peggy: I go to communion to-morrow at
the eight-o’clock Mass. This is to let you know.
Your pal,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Bobby</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy in the course of these three days had
received twenty-four written communications
from her pal. They were all carefully preserved
among her treasured possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Bobby,” she exclaimed on the reading
of this, the twenty-fifth, “may I sit next to you,
and go up alongside and receive with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was hoping you would ask that,” returned
Bobby. “I won’t miss mother so
much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then with bright and flashing eyes they
broke into a conversation which would not interest
the reader, but which, I am sure, was
listened to with loving attention by at least
two angels. How long they would have continued
is beyond conjecture had not Miss Bernadette
Vivian happened along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re talking once more, are you?” she
remarked. “Let me in, too, on this conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I forgot,” said Bobby, looking contrite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so did I,” added Peggy. “Bobby!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby looked into her reproving eyes and
beheld a warning finger at her lips. They
talked no more that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this odd triduum Bobby made it a
point on the way home to visit the Blessed
Sacrament. He remained on each occasion
for half an hour, during which time his uncle
indulged in conversation with Father Mallory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the last day Bobby made his general confession,
while Peggy waited without on her
knees, her eyes fastened on the tabernacle, her
lips moving in prayer that her pal might make
it a good one. They parted wordlessly without
the vestibule, though it was a matter of
five minutes before their adieus were completed.
Indeed, they might have gone on for
a much longer period in their making of farewells
had not a bright-eyed boy, an acolyte of
the church, after watching them for a few minutes
in wide-eyed amazement, called out to a
young friend on the sidewalk, “Hey, Jimmie,
come on here quick. There’s a couple of deaf-mutes
here talking the sign language.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they parted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning the romantic little church
at Hollywood had, considering that it was a
week day, an unusual number of worshipers
at the eight-o’clock Mass. The director, Joseph
Heneman, was there, and every actor in
the play now nearing completion. Even the
exponent of the Delsarte system, a chastened
young lady, was in attendance. Many were
non-Catholics. Many had come to see, but, I
firmly believe, all remained to pray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before the Mass Mr. Compton, looking
like the last possibility in the way of a
comedian, walked up the aisle behind Bobby,
who, with eyes cast down and hands clasped
in reverence, seemed oblivious, as in fact he
was of course, of everything and every one.
Compton saw him into a seat in the front pew
and modestly took his own place in the pew
behind. A few seconds later Peggy appeared.
She walked up the aisle rather briskly. Nor
were her eyes cast down. Peggy had business.
It was no difficult task to discover
Bobby, and to him she went. Leaning over
so as to bring her head on a line with that of
the kneeling boy, she handed him an ivory-bound
prayer-book, her own communion present
for the lad. Then she opened the book
and pointed out to Bobby the prayers he should
recite in preparation for his first communion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby and Peggy were dressed in white; and
if ever that color, emblematic of innocence,
was appropriate to any occasion, it was appropriate
to this. To some gazing on the two
it was a vision. A non-Catholic, a man who
had scored and been scarred in the battle of
life, whispered to his neighbor:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How those little ones love each other!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are right,” returned the other. “And
it is a love which draws down in admiration
‘the angels in heaven above,’ and sends ‘the
demons down under the sea’ scattering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just what I mean,” said the first,
and—a thing that had not occurred in his life
since early boyhood—fell to praying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy, having accomplished her mission,
now passed over to the opposite pew, where,
kneeling as immobile as a statue, she remained
until the time of communion. The two went
up together, and as they passed up to the communion
railing a wave of the supernatural
swept over every one present; and when, having
received the Body of the Lord, they arose
and turned, their faces were enough to make an
atheist believe in God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The non-Catholics present were carried
away; and they left the church as though they
had seen a vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To describe the breakfast, with Bobby at the
head and Peggy at the foot, and every member
of the company seated between, would be
an anti-climax. It was a happy party.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE END OF ONE SCENARIO AND THE OUTLINING OF COMPTON’S GREAT IDEA</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On that very day the picture was to be finished.
So far the going had been unusually
good, and the wind-up would take but
a few hours. It mattered little, therefore, that
the director began work an hour late. Present
at this last rehearsal were a striking-looking
boy of eight or nine and an extremely beautiful
girl of seven. Bobby’s eyes rested upon
them, and, as he showed by a grin, he was
pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Bobby,” said the boy, reaching
out the hand of cordiality. “My name is
Francis Mason. I’m in the movies myself.
Say, I saw you make your first communion.
It was nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little girl during this introduction was
beaming impartially on both. It was the sweet
smile of trusting youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was there too, Bobby,” she added. “I’m
not a Catholic, but it was just lovely. My
name is Pearl Wright. I’m in the movies,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve come to see you and Peggy,” smiled
Francis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added Pearl. “We’ve heard a lot
about you; and it was very nice of Mr. Compton
to get us in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Peggy came over, and a fellowship
was there and then formed between the four
juvenile stars, which, in the retrospect, will
take on all the glory of romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At about eleven o’clock Peggy and Bobby
had completed their work. So far as they
were concerned the picture was done. Then
it was that Compton called the four children
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Mr. Compton,” said Francis, “those
two sure know how to act. It beats anything
I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I think,” Pearl put in. “I
could just look at Peggy and Bobby all day
and all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know, children, how glad I am
to see you get on so well together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re friends, you see,” smiled Pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you,” said Compton. “Now come
with me.” Saying which he led them into a
set well screened off from observation.
“There’s a little dance in the play, Pearl and
Francis, which is done by Peggy and Bobby.
It’s a very pretty thing, and is really the creation
of Peggy Sansone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” dissented the Italian. “I just saw
a minuet and a gavotte and some other dances
and pieced them together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was fine piecing, at any rate, Peggy.
Now what I like about it is that it has all
that is lovely you can find in any dance, and
expresses grace and springtime and innocent
gayety without the least taint of the low or
the sensual. Now I want you two children to
watch Peggy and Bobby while they do it for
your benefit. I’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In point of fact he did not return until the
word finis, almost two hours later, had been
pronounced. The picture was done. When
he returned he was in the company of Mr.
Heneman. Their entrance was not observed;
the four youngsters were too engrossed to be
easily aroused. Bobby was placing Francis in
a pose which called for some unusual control
of one’s equilibrium; Peggy was marking a
line on the floor, upon which Pearl was gazing
as though it were an exhibit of diamonds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I tell you?” said Compton triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a prophet,” answered the manager,
smiling broadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, goody!” cried Peggy, lifting her eyes
and spying the visitors. “You’re just in time.
Francis and Pearl, just as soon as we finished,
started to do it themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha!” said Compton <span class='it'>sotto voce</span>. “Didn’t
I tell you? Imitation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” added Bobby, “and they came mighty
near getting it right the first time. Didn’t
they, Peggy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They did, Bobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then,” put in Pearl with dancing eyes,
“Peggy started us to making it a dance for
four. And we’ve had such a good time that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we didn’t miss you at all,” broke in
Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” added Francis, looking at his wrist
watch, “we didn’t even notice it was an hour
past dinner time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look,” said Compton to the director.
“Could you, from here to New York, find four
sweeter children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they’re all first-rate actors, too,” said
the manager, who looked as happy as though
he had come into a fortune. “Compton, I
think you have hit upon a big thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it,” said Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children meanwhile had put their heads
together, literally and figuratively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do it,” said Peggy to Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you do it. It’s your dance, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” sighed Peggy. Then advancing
to the two elders, she went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, wouldn’t you like to see our little
dance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing would please us better,” answered
Heneman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. Come on now; we’re going to
show them what we’ve learned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is hard to interest a seasoned director
in such things, and almost impossible to secure
the interest of a Compton. But there are
exceptions to every rule. For five minutes or
more the audience of two was spellbound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a variation of the original dance, a
wonderful variation, retaining all its grace
and beauty and springtime aroma, with little
touches, magical touches, which charmed it into
the realms of fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By jove,” roared the manager, “that’s simply
wonderful! Peggy, you’re a genius!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen, children,” said Compton. “You’ve
done more than I expected. I had a bet with
the manager that if I put you together, Pearl
and Francis would go to work and pick up that
dance. But you’ve done more. You’ve saved
me the trouble of getting up a dance to fit into
our new scenario which we start at the day
after to-morrow. It is called ‘Imitation,’ and
you are all four to be in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children gazed at each other in speechless
joy and wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are to be four principals: Bobby,
Francis, Peggy and Pearl. Mr. Heneman and
myself have chosen you because we know you
can act, and—and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because we love you,” supplemented Heneman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Pearl and Peggy threw their
arms about each other’s necks and the two boys
rolled over in ecstasy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that is what you’ve been working on,
uncle?” asked Bobby when he had finally come
once more to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You gave me the idea, Bobby. You
know you’re always doing what other people
are doing. You’re always taking somebody
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like a policeman?” inquired Pearl.
“Well,” she went on to explain, “the policeman
on our beat sometimes takes people off. I saw
him once myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Peggy, drawing Pearl aside, instructed
her in the meaning of the expression on this
occasion, Mr. Compton proceeded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea came to me on the day you took
off that Delsarte girl and got wooled for your
pains. It struck me that I could build up a
story on the idea of four entirely different children,
different in their surroundings, their station
in life, their education and their refinement,
being brought together. The tenement
girl is thrown in with the daughter of a magnate;
and the son of the same magnate is
thrown in with a tough little kid who is by
way of developing into a first-rate pickpocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like the first part of Oliver
Twist?” ventured Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a way, yes. But here’s the difference:
No children are really bad, and some who are
on the way to wickedness may have splendid
qualities. And that’s the way it is to be in this
play. All four children are to have splendid
qualities. Francis will be the tough boy; but
he is naturally kind and brave. Bobby will
be the magnate’s son—good, but sissified.
Peggy will be a child of the tenements, rough
in her ways and uncouth. You, Pearl, will
be the magnate’s daughter, nice as pie, but
babyish. And you and Peggy will fall to liking
each other just the same as Bobby and
Francis. And here’s where the difference
comes in from the story of Oliver Twist. Because
you like each other you will each try
to resemble each other. What Peggy admires
in Pearl she will try to be; and Pearl will try
to resemble Peggy in her best qualities. You
see the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the action coming in?” asked
Francis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that’s another thing. A kidnaper
steals the magnate’s two children. He puts
the girl in a tenement in charge of Peggy’s
father, and puts the boy with a friend who is
a thief and a maker of thieves. Peggy and
Francis, their children, are won over by love
to your side, Bobby. They help you to escape.
Francis and Bobby succeed in escaping
first. Then Francis traces you girls, and he
and Bobby contrive to get you free. You
tramp along the road until, footsore and
weary, you happen upon the home of a kind
and fairly wealthy married couple. It is there
that Peggy and Pearl, who have long danced
together, teach you, and it is there that Bobby’s
and Pearl’s mother unexpectedly arrives,
and clasps her children to her arms, and Francis
doesn’t have to pick pockets or Peggy sell
newspapers any more. The magnate and his
family find that their boy and girl have kept
all their good qualities and gained many new
ones, while, as for Peggy and Francis, they
have so changed that no friend of former days
would know them. And so you live happily
ever afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, that’s swell!” cried Francis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just love it!” exclaimed Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And am I to wear the tenement clothes in
the dance?” asked Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I’d like to know, too—about
my clothes,” said Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. The nice gentleman and his wife,
once they have seen you rehearse, dress you up
just fit to kill, and all four of you when you
do your dance will look like magnified humming
birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so glad to hear that!” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever see a girl,” observed the philosophic
Francis, “who didn’t like to fix herself
up in her prettiest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were just as anxious as I was,” flared
Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s going to be great,” said Francis.
“I wish we could start in right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting broke up in happy shouts and
merry laughter, and, I believe, all four in slumber
dreamed that night of happy things, not
far off, but coming towards them in the bright
hues of romance.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BOBBY BECOMES FAMOUS OVERNIGHT</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, how is your ‘Imitation’ getting
along?” asked the head of the scenario
department in the Lantry Studio some three
weeks later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting on!” repeated Compton. “Getting
on is no name for it. Do you know, Moore,
that, other things being equal, children are the
finest actors in the world? You see, they are
docile. You tell ’em to do a thing and how
to do it; and if they get your meaning that’s
enough. Of course we’re extremely fortunate;
we’ve got together four of the brightest
children in or out of movieland. And they are
such pals! They all stand up for each other;
they all help each other. Of course they have
a little tiff now and then. Otherwise we
wouldn’t know they were human. We might
conclude that they were not descended from
Adam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” said the astonished Moore, taking his
pipe out of his mouth. “Where did you get
that sort of talk? I thought you were a giddy
pagan, foolish but harmless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” laughed Compton, reddening slightly,
“I hope I’m getting more sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need it,” said Moore dryly, replacing
his pipe and puffing comfortably. “But to return
to our mutton—which one of your heaven-descended
quartet is doing best?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” returned Compton, “is a question
which Joe Heneman and myself discuss every
day. Sometimes we think it’s Peggy. Those
large, dark eyes of hers can be so wistful and,
on occasion, so tragic. The next day we settle
upon Francis. In dealing with Bobby in
the play he can be so genial and smile upon
him with the serene philosophy of one so much
older, so much more intimately acquainted with
the ways of the world. By the time we have
settled upon Francis along comes Pearl with
the sweetest smile and the most gracious manner.
Bobby is in the running all the time.
In the trick of imitating he leads them all. We
haven’t come yet to the great scene, the scene
where he meets his mother after an absence of
four weeks. That, so far as the children are
concerned, is the last scene. I’m confident
that Bobby, if he performs it as I think, will
bring tears to the eyes of millions; and if he
does he will be the star of stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know, Compton, that Bobby made
his first screen appearance on the Broadways
of the big cities yesterday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fact! I had quite forgotten.
Yesterday was the day of release. I hope
they’ll like me in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think they’ll bother about you. It
is Bobby they will like,” said Moore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I forgot to look at the papers this
morning,” mused Compton regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not forget, but I haven’t had time.
Wait a minute; there may be something about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moore returned shortly, wearing a smile and
waving the Los Angeles <span class='it'>Times</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, that old thing of yours, ‘You Hardly
Can Tell,’ has scored a tremendous hit. Look
at these headlines!” And Compton looked and
gasped. These were the headlines:</p>

<div class='lgc' style=''> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='sc'>Who Is the Star of “You Hardly Can Tell?”</span></p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line'><span class='it'>Bobby Compton the New Juvenile Star or John Compton the Comedian? You Hardly Can Tell.</span></p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Say,” exclaimed Compton, running his eyes
down the review itself, “that’s good stuff! I’m
a little jealous of my reputation, but there are
a few persons in the world who may outshine
me, and I’m glad of it; and Bobby is first of
all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Moore, “that you’ll have
plenty of chance to be glad, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy comes by his gifts honestly,” continued
Compton. “His father was an actor,
and as for his mother, though she never appeared
upon the regular stage, she was a wonder,
both at the convent school and later in
society, as an amateur actress. Nothing could
persuade her to go on the stage, though she
received before her marriage most tempting
offers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know a lot about her,” said Moore
incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t live in Los Angeles all my life,”
returned Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, say, uncle,” cried Bobby, all out of
breath, “there’s a reporter man here and he
wants to take my picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men glanced at each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold the entrance to the gates of fame,”
exclaimed Moore, airily waving his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, Bobby,” said Compton, “I’ll go
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, uncle, what’s a Lothario?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” queried the amazed comedian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A L-o-t-h-a-r-i-o?” spelled the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s the name of a person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your name Lothario, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not. What makes you ask
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I heard that new star with the
doll face, Bennie Burnside, say that you were
a gay Lothario.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bennie Burnside,” said Compton severely,
“on the outside is a fine figure of a man from
the soles of his feet to the top of his head. On
the inside he is absolutely perfect up to and including
his neck. He is a matinee idol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, uncle, what is a gay Lothario?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is said of the kind of fool who is soon
parted from his money; it means a man whose
most earnest endeavor is to make an ass of
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not a fool, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Bobby. I will try to believe
you. Anyhow, I may be a fool now, but I am
not the forty-three varieties of fool I once
was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, so great a change had come upon
John Compton since the arrival of Bobby that
all the world—the moving-picture world, at
any rate—wondered. Nothing could persuade
him to leave his quarters at night. The
dance knew him no more; the hotel lobby,
whither a certain set of foolishly joyous moving-picture
men most did congregate, missed
him from his accustomed place. A local magistrate
wondered what had become of him. He
had not been fined for speeding in five weeks.
In a word, John Compton had suddenly abandoned
his mad quest of pleasure, and, having
abandoned the quest, was cheerier, happier
than he had been since attaining his majority.
Compton was known to be a man of more than
ordinary intellect. His friends had for years
expected great things of him. In college days
he had given promise of developing into a
writer of taste and imagination. But he had
so far disappointed these high expectations.
His pen had been barren, his life had been
strewn with good intentions—till Bobby came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now it was so different. He had written
a scenario, “Imitation,” which was new in
matter, touching in treatment, and which, in
the opinion of the Lantry Studio critics, gave
promise to set a high mark for other scenario
writers. He was already busy upon a second
play. Bobby was almost his sole companion
in these days, Bobby and Father Mallory, for
whom he had conceived a strong liking, and
whom he visited regularly every afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the two made their way to an office where
the reporter was cooling his heels there came
swooping upon them, dressed for their respective
parts, Peggy and Francis and Pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, Bobby!” “Gee, Bobby!” “Oh,
Bobby!” they shouted in a splendid enthusiasm,
“you’re in the headlines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had the morning paper between them,
and in each one’s endeavor to show Bobby the
place and the words they damaged the sheet
considerably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we’re all so glad!” said Francis, who
had himself starred in five productions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re proud of you, Bobby,” said Pearl,
smiling angelically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we all love you,” chimed in Peggy,
“and Mr. Compton,” she thoughtfully added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just wait until I read this,” said Bobby.
And while, moving his mouth in the slow pronunciation
of each word, the lad read his own
praises, Francis, in a dreamy ecstasy, seated
himself, absently placing in his mouth the pipe
he was later to use in the production, and gazed
upon the loved one in happy and ungrudging
admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just wait till they see ‘Imitation,’ ”
said Bobby, after glancing over the text under
the headlines. “Then they’ll have something
to write about. I don’t mean me. I mean
you, Peggy, and you, Pearl, and you, Francis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And just think of the heaps and heaps of
fun we’re having,” chortled Peggy. “People
say we’re working during vacation. Do you
call this work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should say not,” said the other three, one
after the other in such quick succession that
their words almost chimed together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they went on to chat gayly of their present
joy and their future plans, Compton was
in earnest converse with Joe Heneman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Heneman,” he said, “may I offer
a suggestion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve known you to do it before and come
away with your life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, can’t you run the children through
their parts right away and hold up all the
other parts till the little ones have finished?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? What’s the big idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The big idea is this: the detective agency
has a hunch that Mrs. Vernon is dead.
They’ve sent me a story about some woman
picked up dead near San Luis Obispo, and they
claim it is Barbara. That is, they claim it’s
Bobby’s mother. When I got that letter two
days ago I nearly dropped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you tell Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of an idiot do you think I am?
Of course I didn’t. And after the first shock
I did not believe a word of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe that she’s alive, because Bob is
certain. You ought to see that boy pray!
Why, that boy has all heaven on his side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll be—” Not finishing his expression
of astonishment, Heneman went on:
“But what under the sun has this to do with
hurrying the children through their parts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, just this: Bobby’s picture is going
into the papers. His mother will see or hear
of it. She’ll trace him up. You know she
thinks he’s dead. She’ll come here, and who
can keep her from taking him away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not half as foolish as they say you
are,” was Heneman’s comforting comment.
“You’re right, Compton. Let me see. I think
with full time we can get them through by
next Monday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go to it,” urged Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this very moment Barbara Vernon,
propped up in bed, pale and weak, was for
the first time since her collapse awakening to
the existence of a world from which she had
well-nigh departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank God, thank God!” little Agnes
was saying. “This is the first time nurse let
me in to see you. And she says you will be
all right in a week or ten days at the most.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agnes, I know I am going to get well. I
had such a beautiful dream last night. My little
son, my dear little son, appeared to me.
He looked just as alive as when I last saw him.
And he said, ‘Mother, sweet mother, faith can
move mountains.’ And then he pressed his
dear lips upon mine and disappeared. I awoke
then, but I felt that he had been with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And do you now think he is alive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, my dear. But I feel so
happy. O God, give me the faith that moves
mountains!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hereupon entered the nurse, wearing the
mien of one who had fought long and conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a happy day,” she said blithely. “The
doctor will be along before noon, but we don’t
need any doctor to tell that you’re getting well.
Do you know, Mrs. Vernon, that you were calling
for your little Bobby day and night all
these weeks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; and it was always in a tone of sadness
or of despair. But last night it was different.
You called his name but once, and
your voice sounded as though you were gazing
upon some heavenly vision, and your face
grew beautiful and joyous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand why,” said Barbara. “Agnes,
do you tell her my dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Agnes, almost word for word, repeated
Mrs. Vernon’s account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” pursued the smiling invalid,
“I’m going, with God’s grace, to wait in patience
and faith till that day ‘when dreams
come true.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” observed the nurse, “that there’s
a lady outside that would like to see you.
Come in, Mrs. Regan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mrs. Regan entered and fondly embraced
the woman who had saved her life.
Then came Louis and then the father; and all
lavished upon the dear convalescent a wealth
of simple, homely love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word!” said Barbara, as, after
a few minutes of affectionate conversation, the
visitors reluctantly departed, “I never imagined
since I lost Bobby that I could be so
happy.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BERNADETTE’S TEMPERAMENT DELAYS THE SCENARIO, AND MRS. VERNON MAKES TWO CHILDREN HAPPY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was Monday, the day on which Mr. Joseph
Heneman had counted to finish all
that part of the picture in which the four children
were to appear. And it looked, in the
morning, as though he would be right in his
reckoning. But in the closing scene, the scene
in which Bobby was to surpass himself, there
came an unexpected hitch, and no other than
our friend, Miss Bernadette Vivian, was the
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like most rising artists, Bernadette was
temperamental, which, in other words, signifies
that she was too easily swayed by her feelings.
Now it had happened that on the previous
evening she had met a most pleasing
and engaging young man; and with the two
it was a case of love at first sight. On this day,
therefore, her shapely head was filled with visions
of orange blossoms, bridal veils and a
teasing wonder as to what kind of engagement
ring he would select. With all these matters
on her mind, is it at all surprising that she
was in no mood to represent a mother meeting
her lost children?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was, in this particular scene, to register
the agony of separation, the ecstasy of meeting,
and the tears of joy, all of which things
Miss Bernadette signally failed to accomplish.
The only thing that could have brought comfort
to her soul and any expression of joy to
her face would be her young man advancing
smilingly upon her, holding in his dear hand
a diamond engagement ring. In vain did
Heneman expostulate with her; in vain did
Compton remonstrate. In vain, too, did
the four children, whom she really loved,
cast upon her glances of friendly reproach.
Nothing could arouse her from “love’s young
dream,” than which, we are credibly informed
by a poet, “there’s nothing half so sweet in
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to this day Bernadette had been ambitious.
She was a star in embryo, and her
laurels were in the winning. But the young
man whose bright smile still haunted her was
very wealthy. Upon marrying him she would
retire at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Mr. Heneman said things that any proper
censor would properly delete, let it be said in
his defense that he said them under his breath;
for the director, as no doubt four guardian angels
urged in his behalf at heaven’s chancery,
ever cherished the highest reverence for children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By four o’clock of that evening the director
was unnerved, Compton almost frantic, the
children in ill humor. They were all worn
out. And if the four youthful thespians did
quarrel a little and sulk for almost ten minutes,
let it be said in their behalf that before
going home they all abjectly apologized one
to the other, and proved once more the truth
of Tennyson’s lines:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Oh, blessings on the falling-out</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Which all the more endears!</span></p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>During all this Miss Bernadette, happily
seated and with crossed legs, powdered her
nose, consulted her hand mirror and, for the
nonce an unmitigated flapper, gazed heavenward
with a smile that would have been absolutely
idiotic on a young lady less favored
of feature. The distress of all her friends
impressed her not in the least. In fact, it
never dawned upon her consciousness that
anybody was distressed. Truly, love is
blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Attention, please!” called Heneman when
it was nearing five o’clock. “The weather is
rather close and it has been a trying day. Perhaps
that’s the reason we can’t get this reuniting
business over. I’m sorry, but we’ll
have to try it over to-morrow at ten. The play
is going to be a big thing, and so far you’ve
made it a big thing. But we don’t want an
anti-climax to spoil it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of an aunty is that?” asked
Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remark sent them all off in good
humor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby went to confession before going to
the suite. He confessed, by the way, every
week, and went with Peggy to communion
every morning. Also, he lingered to make a
special and earnest prayer for that falling star,
Bernadette, and I fear that if Bernadette, in
the light of what happened that evening, were
to have learned the import of that prayer, she
would have waylaid Bobby and given him a
sound spanking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O good Lord”—such was the import of
Bobby’s prayer—“bring that nice young lady,
Bernadette Vivian, to her senses; and do it in
a hurry so that to-morrow we can shoot that
scene the way it ought to be shot, and be done
with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night the lovers met and there were five
minutes of unbroken bliss. In these five minutes
they plighted their troth over and over.
Nothing in the heavens above or the earth beneath
or the waters under the earth could ever
dissever their souls. In the next five minutes
there arose a slight difference about the style
of the engagement ring; and before the quarter
was quite ended both were in a towering rage
and vowed repeatedly never, never to look
upon each other’s face again. Then the idol
of her heart went out and got drunk—a weakness
of his of which Bernadette was entirely
ignorant—and left his fond one bathed in
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bad night for Bobby, too. An inconsiderate
friend of Compton’s, Benny Burnside,
meeting Bobby as he returned from confession,
asked the boy whether it was true that
his mother was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she is not dead,” answered Bobby
resolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad to hear it! So that
woman they found dead in the woods at San
Luis Obispo was not your mother after all,”
continued the admired one of every flapper in
the land. It was he who had said that Compton
was a gay Lothario.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby’s lips quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon Mr. Benny Burnside told him,
not without some embroidery to make the story
more convincing, of the reports of the detective
agency on the case. If Mr. Burnside did
not fully convince the lad of his mother’s
death, it was not due to any lack of effort on
his part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby, on retiring, had several sleepless
hours. Faith struggled with alleged fact, and
the struggle brought with it agony and tears.
But the boy was not alone in the fight. To
his aid he summoned the Mother of God, his
guardian angel, his patron saint. Before midnight
confidence returned; and Bobby, his
face still wet with tears, fell into a dreamless
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On that same day, in the morning hours,
Mrs. Barbara Vernon, seated on the ranchman’s
front porch, a deep peace upon her face,
touched once more with the glow of health,
looked out calmly upon a world made strangely
beautiful through the magic given only to the
eye of the convalescent. Never, even in the
first blush of maidenhood, had she looked more
beautiful. Sickness had etherealized her
beauty. Upon her features was the resignation
which, falling short of joy, gives contentment
touched with melancholy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Vernon!” cried two eager
voices, their owners rushing through the
front door in a race to reach her first. Agnes
and Louis were flushed with unusual excitement.
Something big had come into their
lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, my dears? Good news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In answer to which, Louis, raising his voice
to a shrill pipe, poured forth a volume of sound
as intelligible as though his mouth were cluttered
with pins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what is it?” asked Barbara, breaking
into a smile. “I can’t make out a word you
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me talk, Louis,” said Agnes, making
sure of the success of this request by clapping
her hand over the excited youth’s mouth, and
keeping it there. “Mrs. Vernon, there’s a matinee
at the moving-picture house of San Luis
Obispo this afternoon, and—and—” Here
Agnes manifested her excitement by losing her
breath, taking advantage of which, Louis, very
much handicapped by the restraining hand still
held over his mouth, made an effort to say,
“Won’t you come?” giving the effect, however,
of a bulldog’s growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” continued Agnes, “it’s a swell show.
And, oh, Mrs. Vernon, wouldn’t you like to
come with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think,” Barbara made answer,
“that I am in a mood just yet for anything
like that. I am sure you can go by yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand of Agnes dropped, as did her jaw.
Louis dug his fists into his eyes. The girl’s
lips quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if you would like to have me,” amended
the convalescent, reading sympathetically the
signs of woe in the children, “why, of course—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whoop-la!” yelled Louis, running at breakneck
speed towards the door and yelling in his
flight. “Hey, dad! she’s going to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are so kind, Mrs. Vernon!” cried
Agnes. “Just now papa got a long-distance
telephone call from San Luis Obispo. There’s
a friend of his there who went to the picture
show last night, and he called dad up to tell
him what a nice, clean picture it was. He says
that it’s a first-run picture. The proprietor
of the movie house there generally uses older
runs, but there’s some kind of convention in
the town this week, and so he engaged this
new picture and raised the admission price
from twenty to forty cents, and added three
matinees. And the man said that if dad wanted
to go he would hold five tickets for us. And
dad said he would go and take ma and us children,
provided you would go. Oh, isn’t that a
treat? We’ll start in an hour. Dad thinks
that the ride and a picture like that will do
you a lot of good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you let me know at first that
you couldn’t go unless I went? Indeed I’m
sure it will make me happy, if for nothing else
than that it will give joy to two of the dearest
little children I have ever met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so fifteen minutes later Barbara, Mr.
and Mrs. Regan, and the happy children were
speeding onward to San Luis Obispo.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MRS. VERNON ATTENDS A MOVING-PICTURE SHOW AND FINDS IN IT A GREAT LESSON UNTHOUGHT OF BY THE AUTHOR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The lobby of the San Luis Obispo moving-picture
house was thronged, and there
was a crush at the ticket office. As Regan and
his party pushed their way to the entrance, the
ticket seller was announcing that the house was
sold out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To get through this unheard-of crowd Mr.
Regan was forced to use his elbows freely.
Mrs. Vernon and his family, according to
his directions, followed him in close single
file. None of them had an opportunity
to notice the posters and the pictures of various
scenes in the much heralded play. Had
the lobby been less thronged, it is doubtful
whether they would have attended the performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To accommodate all,” cried a strong voice
as they reached the ticket taker, “there will be
another performance at four o’clock sharp; and
until a quarter to four positively no more seats
will be sold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two-thirty to the second, but a few minutes
after the Regan party had seated themselves,
the lights went out and the “News of
the Week” was flashed upon the curtain. The
assembled crowd, filling every seat, had not
come for the “News of the Week”; hence they
were in no wise disappointed when it was taken
off, with most of the news left out. The manager
with a view to the second performance was
shortening his program.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s pause, and then there
flashed upon the screen the words, “You
Hardly Can Tell”; whereupon everybody sat
up and adjusted himself for the promised
treat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the only exception was Mrs. Vernon.
Seated between Agnes and Louis,
she was affectionately watching now one,
now the other, and rejoicing in their eager
joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The story at the first moved slowly, a close-up
being given of a few of the leading characters,
including first and foremost the fair
Vivian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t she sweet!” exclaimed Agnes breathlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a nice face,” returned Barbara,
raising her eyes momentarily to the
screen and then turning them once more upon
Agnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the girl’s face changed from admiration
to merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, look! Ain’t he funny!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon did look and gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There grinning upon them all with a fatuous
face, made still more fatuous by the arrangement
of his hair, was her old friend—and
more than friend—John Compton! There
came back vividly to her the memory of their
last meeting, something over ten years ago,
when she had parted in sorrow and he in anger,
and, as he said bitterly, forever. She was
glad to see his face once more—glad and disappointed.
She had expected more of him.
His name by this time should have been known
far and wide, not as a wearer of the motley,
but as a writer, a thinker, a leader of men;
and why had he disappointed her expectations?
At the moment a feeling of remorse came upon
her. She meditated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was just. But was I kind? It is true I
could never bring myself to marry a man who
refused to believe in God. But was I not
brutal in the way I refused him? Possibly,
if I had been gentle and patient, he might have
been brought to the truth. Forgive, O my
God, the offenses of a proud and unthinking
youth.” Thus meditating she was suddenly
brought back to the present by a roaring and
laughing and stir that were little short of tumult.
Agnes jumped to her feet, and remembering
herself, sat down again exclaiming, “Oh!
oh! oh!” Louis had risen uttering yelps of delight,
and remained standing until a justly aggrieved
man behind him dragged him back to
his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon raised her eyes and saw Bobby
Vernon!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God! O my God!” she exclaimed,
jumping up herself and for a moment on the
point of rushing up the aisle to catch her Bobby
in her arms. Her long discipline of self-restraint,
however, asserted itself. She reseated
herself, and catching a hand of
Agnes in her own, squeezed it until the child
winced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it was her own Bobby. The twisted
mouth, the bellhop uniform, the serio-comic
face—these were all, in a way, no matter of
surprise to her; for Bobby, as no one knew
better than herself, was a born mimic. But
he was alive! Bobby was alive! “O God!”
she whispered, “there is a faith that can move
mountains. Blessed be Thy name!” She followed
the picture now, but in a way almost unheard
of. It was to her a long, sweet meditation.
Over and over she murmured, “My son
that was dead has come to life again!” “With
God all things are possible.” “Oh, my son, my
son!” Tears coursed down her cheeks, tears
of joy incredible. But no one noticed her. All
were absorbed in the play, and when the lights
were turned on and the performance over, Agnes
was astounded beyond measure at Barbara,
who embraced her almost violently and
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the sweetest, most touching thing
I ever saw. It has taught me never to fail in
trusting in God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Agnes thought it was the most mirth-provoking
thing she had ever seen, and, as to
trusting in God, that lesson, like the flowers
that bloom in the spring, had nothing to do
with the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before leaving the theater Mrs. Vernon, excusing
herself, had a few words privately with
the manager.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>COMPTON’S GREAT SCENARIO IS FINISHED NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Of course the next morning, as Bobby
arose and dressed for Mass, gave with
its golden sunshine and balmy air every promise
of a perfect day. This was the only thing
to be expected. Los Angeles, as far as Bobby
knew, had only one kind of weather. All the
days since his arrival had been gay, fragrant,
cloudless, sunshiny days. The inhabitants of
Los Angeles never bothered to discuss the
weather; it was not the fertile topic of conversation
that it is in the East. When they
spoke of it, it was simply to burst forth into
paeans of praise, generally expressed in the exclamation
“Isn’t it a wonderful day!” and that
always ended further discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Bobby,” said Mr. Compton,
to Bobby’s surprise shaved and dressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, halloa! What got <span class='it'>you</span> up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just thought, Bobby, I’d go along with
you to Mass this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Bobby, puckering his brows. “I
suppose,” he went on after some close conjecturing,
“that you are going to church to pray
for the success of that part that didn’t go right
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is one of the things I am going to
pray for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything else, uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby,” said Compton, ignoring the question,
“did you sleep well last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at first, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought so; you do not look quite up to
form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need Holy Communion, uncle. Then
after breakfast—I need that too—then you
watch me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby, I want to ask you another question.
Did you hear anything yesterday that
worried you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s all over now, I guess,” evaded the
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were crying last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who told you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I heard you moaning, and before
I went to sleep I went into your room. There
were stains of tears on your pillow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle, there was a man yesterday, Benny
Burnside, who tried to make me think my
mother was dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton squeezed his lips together,
and sparks shot from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If all the fools in Los Angeles were sentenced
to death and all were pardoned except
one, he’s the one who would go hang. He’s a
handsome creature; but all his beauty isn’t anywhere
near enough to make up for the tremendous
vacancy in his head. And did you believe
him, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He almost made me believe. That’s what
I was fighting about before I could get to sleep.
But I did feel so mean!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no sense, my boy, in giving up hope
till you have to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, uncle, you were worrying too last
night. You don’t look right yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact John Compton had
passed a long and sleepless night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, suppose we toddle along,” he said,
with a forced smile. So forth went the
two, each struggling for faith against an
uneasiness born of a foolish detective’s rash
report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Francis and Peggy were at Mass and went
to communion. They wanted Bobby to “put
it over,” and directed the intention of their
communion accordingly. Pearl, though not a
Catholic, was there too. She came to pray,
rather startling the worshipers at her entrance
by going up the aisle and making her prettiest
little curtsy before the tabernacle. This
curtsy had won the hearts of many a stranger
in the moment of introduction. No doubt our
Lord’s love for her, already great—for the
dear Lord who was once a child loves all children
in a special way—went out to her in a
new excess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pearl, at the end of Mass, repeated the
curtsy, which would have won her distinction
in any earthly court—and why not in the heavenly?—and
went outside, where she continued
to smile and bow at the returning worshipers
as though they were all friends of hers. And
so far as she was concerned, so they were, God
bless her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Bobby; good morning,
everybody!” she cried, as she shook the hand
of Compton, Bobby, Francis and Peggy, dispensing
as she did so a running stream of
smiles. “It’s going to be all right. I just
know it’s going to be all right. Bobby, you’re
just sure to put it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going to be the greatest day of all,”
chimed in Francis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll be finished before noontime,” added
Peggy. “And you’ll see, Mr. Compton,” she
went on, fixing large, earnest, questioning eyes
upon Compton, “that we haven’t been praying
for nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you, my dear,” returned Compton
humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Peggy, who knew something about
Compton’s religious, or rather irreligious, convictions,
wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m hungry,” said Bob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” said Pearl. “You see, I couldn’t
go to communion, but I could fast and I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Compton, greatly cheered by
the simple, loving little company, “we’ll all
breakfast at the restaurant right below here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls and Francis protested that
their mothers would be worried; whereupon
Compton let loose their arrested joy by assuring
them that he would telephone each proper
home and make himself responsible for the
whole party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breakfast was a success, an abundance
of watermelon and cream cakes being large
factors, and off they hopped and danced, light
as birds and immeasurably gayer, to the last
rehearsal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Bernadette Vivian had preceded them.
She too had had a white night. The day before
she had confided to the amicable clerk who
kept the visitor’s gate and answered the telephone
at the Lantry Studio the story of her
great romance. She had made it clear to that
amiable young lady that her engagement was
as good as settled, that her Romeo, in addition
to a personal pulchritude beyond power
of words to describe, was as wealthy as Colossus—meaning,
no doubt, Crœsus—that he had
four automobiles and a country villa in addition
to a home worth at least thirty thousand
dollars: to all of which the gentle and sympathetic
young lady, discounting each of these
statements by at least fifty per cent, lent an
attentive ear. Now it occurred to Vivian that,
since there was no secrecy enjoined, the young
lady might make her romance known. Hence
it was that, unable to sleep, she hastened down
to the studio bright and early with her revised
version of love’s young dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” she said, after an affectionate
exchange of greetings, “that I am thinking
seriously of entering a convent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be very sweet of you,” said
Miss Cortland. “But you don’t want to break
the heart of that young man, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That young man,” said Miss Vivian darkly,
“has no heart to break!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! Aren’t you going to be engaged
to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were engaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you didn’t tell me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It only happened last night. We were engaged
for over ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” interrupted Miss Cortland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m sick and tired of all men!” ejaculated
Vivian, clasping her hands. “They have
no ideals! They are so—so common! I’ve
always found that out before it was too late.
I’d like to hear what they’ll say when I go
into a convent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you have a quarrel, Vivian?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never quarrel,” returned the young lady
with dignity. “We had a difference of opinion,
and I discovered that his ideals were not
mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By ideals Miss Vivian must have meant diamonds.
The kind she wanted for her engagement
was the kind her swain disliked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, anyhow, I’ve learnt a good lesson.
And, oh, I’m so miserable! I slept badly, and
I feel like going to Ocean Park and throwing
myself into the sea. Upon my word, I
believe I will!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Cortland was minded to point out to
the distressed damsel that throwing herself into
the ocean and entering a convent were hardly
compatible; but, thinking better of it, she observed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is your fifth case, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My seventh,” retorted Vivian, indignantly,
and left the office in a huff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To set at rest the minds of Miss Vivian’s
many admirers, it may be stated that she did
not enter a convent, nor has the ocean received
her into its insatiable maw. She realizes still
that there are lots of good fish in the sea, and,
though she nets one every month or so, she
has not yet caught a fish that quite measures
up to her expectations. Her present romance
is now number eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Bobby,” whispered Francis, as they
repaired to the scene of their final rehearsal,
“do you want to shed real tears in the part
where you meet your mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to,” returned Bobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve got a trick to do it. It’s a pinch
I learned from a fellow. It doesn’t make a
mark, but it will smart like fun and bring
the tears. Now, if you need it, just let me
know; we’ve got to put this across.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the event proved, Francis was not called
upon to reduce Bobby to tears. Bobby, thinking
of his own dear mother, and grieving for
her the more bitterly for the ugly rumor which
had left him sleepless, found it an easy task to
imagine Bernadette to be Mrs. Vernon, with
the result that his acting was clearly more perfect
than it had been on the preceding day.
As for Vivian, that volatile young lady, a flapper
yesterday, was now persuaded that she
was refined by a bitter experience, that all love
leading toward matrimony was vanity and affliction
of spirit, and that children were the
most interesting and lovable things in the world.
Thus chastened by these reflections, she put on
a more mature air, diffused an atmosphere of
sorrow akin to despair, and, to the astonishment
and delight of Heneman, Compton and
all the players, went through her part in a
manner that touched the hearts of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great!” cried Heneman. “Now get ready
for the camera! Ready? Shoot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pearl, Peggy and Francis were all in the set.
Pearl, as the magnate’s daughter, had already
met her mother when Bobby entered. He sees
the magnate’s wife standing palpitating and
holding out tender arms. He stares, breaks into
a radiant smile of happiness, cries out “Mother!”
rushes into her arms and weeps upon her
bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Done!” announced Heneman, rubbing his
eyes. “It’s perfect.—Why, what’s the matter,
Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Bobby, released from Vivian’s arms,
was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you ill, my boy?” asked Compton, rushing
over and putting an arm about the lad’s
neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I was th-thinking of my own dear
mother,” sobbed Bobby. As he spoke he raised
his eyes. A moment later they grew wide in
astonishment, wonder and incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there she is!” he exclaimed, darting
forward to meet a woman now hurrying toward
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment Bobby, weeping and laughing,
was rushing into the arms of his own dear
mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tensely dramatic moment. Those
concerned in the play gazed in awe; then realizing
the tremendous strain thus taken off
mother and son, they entered into the joy of
the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton was the first to advance and greet
the happy mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember me, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed and indeed I do! I was thinking of
you yesterday—thinking of the past. And I
have something that I want to say to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s the best man in the world, mamma,”
said Bobby enthusiastically. “He’s treated me
as though I were his own son. Why, uncle,
why have you got your head down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know it,” said Compton. “But
anyhow, I do not feel fit to look upon your dear
mother’s face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impending awkwardness was averted
by the quick approach of the three children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mrs. Vernon!” exclaimed Peggy, her
dark eyes luminous and her olive complexion
alive with rosy emotion, “I’m almost as happy
as you!” And Peggy threw her arms about
Barbara’s neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear little Peggy,” and Mrs. Vernon returned
the embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” Peggy went on, running her words
into one another, “you know it was so stupid
of me to tell you Bobby was dead. Oh, I’m
so glad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I kiss you, ma’am?” said Pearl, with
her charming smile and her graceful curtsy as
Peggy slipped aside. “I’m one of Bobby’s
friends, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I too,” said Francis. And Mrs. Vernon,
flushed and radiant, fondly kissed the two
children, who in their expressions of delight
fell little short of Bobby himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time many of the elders had gathered
about the reunited pair, and all in their
various ways extended their felicitations. Bernadette
Vivian was so overcome with emotion
that she had to be led away by her attendant.
It was a moment of tension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Mrs. Vernon,” whispered Compton;
“my automobile is waiting outside. I am sure
you want to get away and have Bobby to yourself.”
Saying which, he conducted her away
with her boy still clinging to her, and was
presently whirling homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother,” said Bobby, resting in her
arms, “what became of you? Uncle John had
detectives looking all over for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon explained in a few words the
reason of her long disappearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” she added, “when I saw you on the
screen yesterday, I went to the manager of
the theater and found out where you had been
working. He was most kind. He inquired
and learned that a train three hours late would
pass at eleven o’clock that night. He took care
of me and saw me aboard. Mr. Regan and
his family wanted to see me off. Bobby, if we
wish, we can have a home with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby’s not poor,” said Compton.
“There’s twenty-four hundred dollars to his
credit in the bank just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it’s all yours, mother. I was working
for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they entered John Compton’s suite,
Barbara gazed about the sitting-room in
pleased surprise. There was a change in the
room since Bobby’s first entrance there. Most
of the photographs were gone, and most prominent
of all the pictures adorning the walls was
a beautiful engraving of a guardian angel tenderly
watching his innocent charge, a little boy,
in years and appearance resembling Barbara’s
son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” she exclaimed, blushing prettily.
“Do you believe in angels, John Compton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do! Indeed I do! And I learned that
sweet belief from your own little boy’s example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” pursued Mrs. Vernon, “then you
must believe in God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barbara,” responded Compton, with a
catch in his voice, “it must have been God who
sent your boy to me. He has changed my life.
For several weeks, though Bobby doesn’t know
it, I have been receiving instructions from Father
Mallory—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” cried Bobby eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to-morrow I am to be received into
the Catholic Church.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CONTAINING NOTHING BUT HAPPY EXPLANATIONS AND A STILL HAPPIER LOVE SCENE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The hours that followed were given to mutual
explanations. Bobby, at great
length, related his adventures from the time he
was carried away by the breakers to the present
moment. Then John Compton gave his
version, pointing out that he had done everything
to trace up Mrs. Vernon and that from
his knowledge of Bobby picked up in the first
hour of meeting he had judged that, all things
considered, the best way to watch the lad and
keep his mind off the sorrows of separation was
to engage him in moving-picture work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anyhow,” he said, “before I had quite
made up my mind to do it, Bobby settled the
question by actually breaking in; and just as
soon as I saw him show Chucky Snuff how to
do his part, I don’t think I could well have
chosen any other way of meeting the situation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, mother dear,” said Bobby, “we
want you to tell everything about yourself, and
don’t leave anything out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eager interest of Bobby and John
Compton inspired Barbara to a full and enthralling
narrative of her mischances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And to think,” mused Compton, “that all
this strange series of events should have come
about just through the most trivial thing in
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s that, Uncle John?” asked Bobby,
nestling in his mother’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, through a little earth tremor. Of
course you, Mrs. Vernon, and you, Bobby,
were not used to it; but actually it doesn’t
disturb us who live here, especially the native-born,
as much as a loud clap of thunder. Three
months ago we had an actual thunderstorm
here, and there was one flash of lightning and
one clap of thunder like the kind that are so
common in Cincinnati. Now Father Mallory
told me that the children in his school were
so frightened that for a moment there was
danger of a panic. And I have no doubt that
the children who were most frightened were
natives and, because they were natives, would
have hardly paid any attention to an earth
tremor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so, Uncle John,” broke in Bobby.
“Peggy was at school that day and she told
me all about it. She said that when the thunderclap
came she screamed at the top of her
voice, and started for the door. The Sister
got there before her, and blocked her and a
dozen other children, and made them go back
to their seats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, Bobby,” said Compton, “did
you ever think to ask yourself why you were
carried out by that wave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They all say it was the undertow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but in ordinary circumstances it
would not have caught you, as you were not
far enough out. In my opinion, the sea was
affected by the impending earthquake and that
wave was not a normal wave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, thank God,” said the mother, “that
it is all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” said Compton, “thank God that
it all happened. These days with Bobby have
been the happiest of my life. And also—they
have brought you to my home. And that reminds
me; till further notice, Barbara, this
suite is yours. Everything has been arranged.
I have taken a room across the way. You and
Bobby are in command in this suite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you’ll come in any time at all, won’t
you, Uncle John?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That reminds me,” said Compton. “Please
don’t think I am an Indian giver. But I’m
arranging a little party for to-night; and may
I use these rooms? Of course you are both to
be among those present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be absurd, John,” laughed Barbara.
“These are your rooms. By to-morrow I’ll try
and arrange to get a place for myself and
Bobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that,” returned Compton,
with a meaning in his words that escaped both
his hearers. “To-night, Barbara, we’re going
to have Peggy and Pearl and Francis and their
mothers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great!” cried the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is to be a special celebration to honor
the successful end of our play ‘Imitation.’ By
the way, wasn’t it a peculiar coincidence that
you should appear just as Bobby finished his
part of the scenario?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid,” returned Mrs. Vernon, “that
I’m partly responsible for that coincidence.
The man who so kindly let me in to the Lantrey
Studio casually informed me that Bobby
was engaged in finishing up his part of the
picture. I came in, and seeing him working,
remained watching and hiding for ten minutes.
It occurred to me that if I came upon Bobby
while he was working he might not be able to
act. So I watched my little boy till all was
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother,” said Bobby, “if you had come
sooner, you might have ruined that part. I
could never do it again that way, because I was
thinking of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s another reason for this little
party,” Compton went on. “I want you to
meet and to know Bobby’s three pals. I think
you will agree with me that I have managed to
keep him in really good company. These
children are innocent, bright and exceptionally
good, and that they are so is due in no
small part to their mothers, who are always in
attendance, always with them. And that is
why I am inviting the mothers, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How John Compton managed all the details
of this banquet is one of the secrets of
his efficiency. He used the telephone three or
four times and the thing was done. After a
two hours’ spin along roads so perfect that
they are the admiration of Eastern travelers,
the three returned and found a table in the
sitting-room, laid for a banquet, fragrant with
flowers and fruits, and with a caterer in attendance,
who announced that everything was
ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good,” said John, glancing approvingly
at the preparations. “Be ready to serve
dinner in ten minutes. You’ll excuse me,
Barbara; the three children with their mothers
are now gathered together and waiting for
me at the home of Francis Mason. I’ll have
them here in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compton was true to his word. Ten minutes
later gales of light laughter and happy
shouting made known to everybody in the
apartment house that Mr. John Compton was
receiving friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take a good meal, season it with love and
satisfaction over work well done, dash it over
with the joy of reunion, and you have a banquet
fit for the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children chattered gayly and, somehow
or other, ate very heartily at the same time.
Nothing was allowed to interfere with this latter
function. But as all for the greater part
of the meal spoke and laughed at the same
time, it would be impossible, even were it worth
while, to reproduce what they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the end, when the babbling and
laughter were at their loudest, Mr. Compton
tapped his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me for interrupting all of you,” he
said, “but I’m afraid, if you don’t moderate
yourselves, that a patrol wagon will drive up
and we’ll all be hauled to the station house for
disturbing the peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Mr. Compton smiled and made a comic
face the assembled guests, the children especially,
raised a tirra-lirra of silvery laughter.
One would judge from their enjoyment of it
that Mr. Compton had cracked the best joke
in the history of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a full minute, Mr. Compton tapped
his glass again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pleasure to try being funny before
such an appreciative audience. But don’t you
think it would be worth while to take turns
in talking and not all talk at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon all present answered together in
different phrasings that it certainly would be
worth while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good; then, Mrs. Vernon, it’s your
turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vernon promptly said that the voices
of the children were music to her ears, and
that this was an occasion on which children
should be both seen and heard. And so substantially
declared the three other happy
mothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, Francis?” adjured Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Francis, rising
and bowing, “I am going to tell you the
story of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was upon this declaration that the grown
folks broke into laughter, whereat the little
ones wondered where was the joke, anyhow!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the age of three years and a half I went
into the moving-picture business. Since that
time I have starred in five big productions,
not counting this one. And the finest time I
have had in all my life has been the time that
Peggy and Pearl and Bobby have worked with
me. In conclusion, I beg to state that I have
been married five times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The amazed children joined the startled
elders in applause and laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In moving pictures, I mean,” said Francis,
and sat down, the orator of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Pearl?” resumed Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pearl arose smiling and made her curtsy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Encore!” cried everybody, led by Compton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pearl was always ready to smile and curtsy.
Nothing loath she repeated the performance
three times handrunning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to say,” said Pearl, “that my best
love and wishes go to Bobby and his mother.
And, Mr. Compton, Peggy has brought her
violin along. She thought, perhaps, that some
one might ask her to play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine!” said Compton. “We’ll not forget
that. And now, Peggy, it’s your turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy arose radiant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll say what Pearl said,” she declared.
“For Bobby and his mother I have heaps of
love. And Pearl has brought along her dancing
shoes. She told me that some one might
ask her to dance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid! We’ll have an entertainment
presently. Now, Bobby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” cried Bobby, “that Uncle John is
the finest man in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech was the hit of the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bobby,” said Compton, brushing away in a
comic gesture an imaginary tear—not altogether,
imaginary, at that—“you have unmanned
me. But now let’s have a little council
of war. First of all, our play is finished
and you’re all out of a job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really school time, anyhow,” said Francis
consolingly. “I’ve never had a regular year
at school. How I’d like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So should I,” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m old enough to start now,” ended
Pearl, “and I think Ma will allow me to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word!” exclaimed the host.
“This is the first time in all my life that I
heard a bunch of children expressing a desire
to go to school. Shakespeare has set for all
time the picture of the schoolboy with a snail’s
pace trudging unwillingly to school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ah!” said Pearl’s mother. “But Shakespeare
never lived in Los Angeles and in the
days of the moving picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” assented Compton. “All rules fail
in Los Angeles, a city which may rightly be
called ‘different.’ I’m glad you are all ready
for school. I’ve got good news for you. ‘Imitation’
has brought me in a large sum of money.
But I don’t think it is really mine at all.
Bobby here, imitating everybody, gave me the
first idea—the germ of the story. Then I
got to thinking of what sort of people were
most likely to imitate. There was just one
answer—children. Next I thought of you
three, Peggy, Pearl and Francis. After that
it was easy to work out the plot. Now, while
I am keeping a comfortable sum for myself,
I have here in my pocket a check for each one
of you calling for fifteen hundred dollars: and
that has nothing to do with the salary you draw.
I have already spoken to your mothers, and
they are all willing for you to take nine months’
vacation from moving-picture work and go to
school. The check is intended to pay for your
education; and who knows but by next June
I’ll have another scenario for just you four!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment of wondering silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Pearl arose, smiling more engagingly
than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, dear Uncle Compton,” and
curtsied deeper than on any former occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby next arose, and with a smile not unlike
Pearl’s said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you, dear Uncle Compton,” and
duplicated the curtsy of Pearl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Francis and Peggy, wondering what the
laughter from the grown folks was all about,
each in turn made the selfsame speech in the
selfsame way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Compton in struggling to keep a
straight face while witnessing the new “Imitation”
feared for the moment that he was on the
point of an apoplectic seizure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we say grace,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within a few minutes, the table was cleared,
everybody taking a hand. The next thing was
the entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Mrs. Sansone,” whispered
Compton. “Do you and the other women take
the children into Bobby’s room and arrange a
program. Besides Peggy’s violin playing and
Pearl’s dancing, we want Bobby and Francis
to do some little stunt, too. Get them ready
in fifteen minutes at the least. Meantime, I
want to have a word with Mrs. Vernon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the two were alone, standing beneath
the picture of the guardian angel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barbara, you remember your remarking
this morning that you had something to say to
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Distinctly, John. But since that time I
have seen and learned so much that I have
ever so many things to say to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what was it you intended this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This, John: when I saw your face on the
screen in San Luis Obispo last night, I went
back to the years when you and I were so much
together. I recalled how I had refused you
because I couldn’t bring myself to marry a
man who did not believe in God. I think still
that I was right in my decision, but I feel
that I should have been gentler, more patient.
I was young and severe. And last night I felt
that, if ever I met you again, I would try to
explain how sorry I was not for what I did,
but for the way in which I did it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I,” returned Compton, “have been
thinking of you always, indeed, but almost
constantly since I picked Bobby up from the
roadside, and I’ve recalled bitterly my leaving
you as abruptly and in a temper. Every
night for the past three weeks I have said
over and over again Newman’s ‘Lead, Kindly
Light,’ and I have over and over reflected each
time in sorrow and, I hope, true contrition on
the line, ‘Pride ruled my will: remember not
past years.’ Barbara, my father was an infidel
and my mother never bothered about religion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have considered that,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However, that only extenuates my conduct.
Now, Barbara, I want to ask you a very
serious question. Did you love me in those
days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, John dear, whether I can
make myself plain in answering. I liked you
immensely and I was so close to the border
line of love that it was only by a strong struggle
that I didn’t cross it. Had I yielded to
your request that night, love would, I am sure,
have come in the yielding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a fool I was!” exclaimed Compton.
“I was at the gate of Paradise and
turned my back on it, and went out into the
night; and I have been dwelling in outer darkness
since. Barbara, since I left you, I’ve been
no good. I have been light, frivolous, irresponsible.
My career has amounted to nothing.
If God gave me any talents, I have
buried them. All this was true till the coming
of Bobby. Bobby came and he brought
<span class='it'>you</span> back. Before God, I believe I am a
changed man. I have seen the light and to-morrow
I will arise and go into my Father’s
house. To-morrow I am to be received into
the Church, and on Sunday I go to Holy Communion.
Of course, I do not know the future.
How do I know whether I shall be able to persevere
and not go back? But honestly, I believe
I am a changed man. I believe and I
hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have known faith to move mountains,”
observed Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Barbara, you know how I love your
little boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And more,” assented Barbara, “I know
how he loves you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Taking this into consideration, do you think
you could possibly love me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John,” said Barbara, holding out her hand
to him, “there’s no thinking about it after this
wonderful day. I love you with all my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I say,” cried Bobby, a second later, and
seeing what he saw suddenly ceased to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, Bobby,” said Compton, recovering
his composure quickly. “I want to ask
you a question. What relation are you to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First,” answered Bobby, “you were my
aunt; then you were my grandfather, then you
were my nephew. Just at present you are my
uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, dear Bobby, how would you like me
to be your father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bobby looked at his blushing mother and
understood. Catching now one, now the other,
he delivered a hearty kiss and a hug to each,
then throwing himself flat on the floor, he
closed his eyes and said softly but joyously:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FOUR CHILDREN AROUSE SUSPICION, UNTIL WITH THE MOST MOMENTOUS EVENT IN THIS NARRATIVE, ALL IS MADE CLEAR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, folks,” screamed Bobby, arising and
rushing into his own room, “we’re going
to have a marriage in our family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, truly, did pandemonium break loose.
There was no need of further explanation: the
situation was too clear; one had but to look
on Compton and Barbara to know that they
were betrothed. The three mothers fell upon
Barbara, while the children, who one and all
loved the transformed Compton, smothered
that embarrassed young gentleman with hugs
and kisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Attention!” cried Compton as with kind
but firm hands he disengaged himself from the
four affectionate aggressors. “Listen, please.
Each and every one of you here present is
cordially invited to be present at the wedding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?” cried all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see,” and Compton, as he spoke,
wrinkled the brow of calculation. “On next
Sunday, the banns will be read, also on the
second and third Sunday. Then the wedding
will follow on some day of that very week.
What day shall it be, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saturday,” she promptly made answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to be critical, Barbara, but
why put it to the very end of the week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First, John, Saturday is Our Lady’s day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” said Peggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And secondly, it’s the day when the children
are free from school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon the children were by way of initiating
a new pandemonium; but the resourceful
Compton, bellowing that it was time for
the performance, bundled them all out of the
room and called for the first number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peggy played with taste and feeling. She
was of Italian blood, of a race that for art
stands, I believe, first and foremost in the
modern world; and her art went into her graceful
fingers and returned in the sweet notes that
rippled from her bow. Francis recited and, of
course, acquitted himself to the taste of every
one present. Pearl’s dance, under the circumstances,
was an incarnation of spring—a spring
of smiles and youth and fragrant innocence.
Then arose Bobby and brought the spectators
out of fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announced, “I
will now give you a correct picture of Uncle
John when he is shaving himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing without any properties of any sort,
Bobby dipped an imaginary brush in imperceptible
water, rubbed his face, and then lathered
himself with invisible soap. Next he
honed an unseen razor upon a similar strop,
and proceeded to go through the motions of
shaving. To such an extent did he succeed
in reproducing the faces Compton was wont
to make, that the victim of all this fun lost
two buttons from his vest, both of them flying
off when Bobby went through the motions of
cutting himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That settles it,” said Compton, when Bobby
had ended his performance with a caricature of
Pearl’s curtsy. “We’ve had enough for to-night.
The hour is early—it’s only ten—but
to-morrow I am to be received into the Catholic
Church, and I think I ought to have a little
solitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to shave?” asked Francis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” asked Compton, restraining himself
lest he should loose another button.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you were,” answered the youth, “I
should like to look on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon the happy party broke up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night, dear,” said Compton to Barbara,
when all had left the room, including
Bobby, who had graciously accompanied the
departing guests to the street. “Aren’t they
a wonderful set of children?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They show to some degree what God originally
intended us all to be,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a pity that they must all grow up!”
said the happy man.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it possible,” asked John Compton two
weeks later, “that our four children are getting
worldly-minded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not, John,” answered Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely afternoon. The two were
seated in Compton’s former suite, which, since
the engagement, had remained Barbara’s and
Bobby’s temporary home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, they show such an unusual interest
in our wedding clothes,” Compton went on,
“that I do not know what to make of it. Every
time I go to my tailor, I discover Bobby and
Francis either with him or hovering about the
neighborhood, and they always look guilty
when I come upon them. Once Peggy and
Pearl were there, too. I asked the tailor what
it all meant, and he laughed and answered that
the children were very much interested in
my bridal garments. I don’t like to see children
of their age making such a fuss about
styles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that you bring the subject up,” said
Barbara, “I recall that Peggy and Pearl every
time they come here—and there’s not a day
that they don’t—ask to see my trousseau, and
show an interest that I cannot account for.
They ask all sorts of questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another thing,” resumed Compton.
“Several times I have caught the four of them
discussing something or other with intense
earnestness; but no sooner am I seen than they
grow embarrassed and drop their engrossing
subject. For all that, they are, in every other
respect, so lovely, they’re all studying so well,
that I can’t bring myself to think they are
getting worldly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And besides, John, Bobby and Peggy and
Francis go to communion every day. Not
only that, but they make a longer thanksgiving
than most grown people. They are the last
to leave the church; so I can’t imagine anything
wrong about them. And sweet little
Pearl, who reminds me of the Peri at the gate
of Paradise, not exactly disconsolate, but wistful,
comes every morning with them, and says
her little prayers with all the reverence and
devotion of childish love and innocence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My idea of Paradise,” John meditated, “is
a place like Los Angeles, with beautiful
smooth-shaven, green lawns thrown in—flowers
and foliage and sunshine to remain ‘as you
were.’ But the inhabitants of this Paradise
are to be all children in their innocence, unalloyed
by the little failings which go to show
that they are descended from Adam, and who
are never, never to grow up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in a body entered the little four, who,
after a cordial interchange of greetings, timidly
begged to see the bridal dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The betrothed pair looked at each other.
They were mystified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Uncle John,” said Bobby, who, with
Francis, quickly lost interest in the modiste’s
“Creation,” “is it true that you’ve been promoted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been made a Director for the Lantry
Studio, if that’s what you mean, Bobby, and
they have accepted my new scenario at a price
bigger than what they paid for ‘Imitation.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to be rich, uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know about that. But whether I’m
rich or not, you are provided for, my dear. At
least, putting together the money you have
earned this summer with what I have added
to it, and turning it into Liberty Bonds, which
I have been able to buy up at a price yielding
six per cent on the investment, the income will
yield enough to carry you through your school-days,
and when you are done with classes, the
principal will be intact and enough to give you
a fair start in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” objected Bobby, “I thought the
money I earned was going to Mama to help her
pay off that debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t worry about that, Bobby,” exclaimed
Mr. Compton. “Yesterday your
mother sent a check canceling the entire obligation.
She wasn’t as poor as we imagined.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then, John,” put in Barbara, “when
you gave me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Compton smiling amiably put his hand
over her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two girls were still studying the dress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can it be vanity?” the two asked themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All they could do was to suspend judgment.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was Saturday morning, brighter, more
fragrant, more Paradise-like than any morning,
so John and Barbara averred, in the
golden weather history of Los Angeles. The
wedding was over, the most notable wedding
ever held in the Church of the Blessed Sacrament.
The moving-picture world was there,
the moving-picture world, and his wife and
daughters, and, to a surprising extent, his
sons. The church, a bower of beauty, was
filled. All was over, and the happy couple,
preceded by a flower girl, no other than Agnes
Regan, by the best man, Mr. J. Heneman, and
supporting the weeping bridesmaid, Bernadette
Vivian, were moving in stately fashion
down the aisle. As they left the vestibule,
there were, thank goodness, no showers of rice
and other idiotic performances, idiotic, because
out of place at the church. Nevertheless,
there was another form of demonstration.
Two camera men from the Lantry Studio
were on hand with their moving-picture
cameras, and with them Ben Moore, the head
of the Scenario Department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop where you are,” commanded Ben.
“We’re going to take you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t object, my own,” whispered Compton.
“We really owe it to the Lantry people.—Go
on, Ben, and tell us what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way,” continued the groom, “what
on earth has become of the little four? I
haven’t seen or heard of them all the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They told me they had permission to go
up in the choir loft,” answered Mrs. Compton.
“Bobby left at six, one hour and three-quarters
before we started for church. He had something
on his mind.—Well, Ben, why don’t you
go on and shoot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” said Ben severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The groom and bride were standing before
the main door of the church, with the best man
and bridesmaid next them on their proper
sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Move back, you two men to one side, and
you two women to the other to give place to
the procession. Now, boys, shoot,” commanded
Ben.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the bridal party obeyed Moore’s curt
injunctions, there issued forth from the
church, Bobby, dressed in every detail like
Compton; on his arm, Peggy, arrayed like
Mrs. Compton. Behind them, came Francis,
another Heneman, his arm supporting Pearl,
an improved replica of the fair Bernadette
Vivian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By George,” cried Compton, never for a
moment thinking of the cameras now in operation.
“This explains the whole thing.—The
little monkeys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young mischief-makers, well out of the
church, placed themselves in front of the real
bridal group, in front of their respective
replicas. Four innocent faces then broke into
smiles, while their owners made Pearl’s famous
curtsy to an imaginary audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon this, Bobby turned and presenting a
rose to Compton, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Imitation.</span>’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Is</span>,” announced Peggy, presenting the
flower to Barbara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Sincerest</span>,” added Francis, with a rose
for Heneman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Flattery</span>,” ended Pearl, addressing the fair
Bernadette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Compton caught Bobby in his arms;
and Barbara caught Peggy in her arms; and
Heneman caught Francis in his arms; and
Bernadette caught Pearl in her arms; while
the cameras clicked furiously, until they
stopped, and Ben Moore announced that,
without rehearsal, they had shot the finest
thing ever seen in any moving picture.</p>
